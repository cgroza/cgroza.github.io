  abstract = {A key goal of whole-genome sequencing for studies of human genetics is to interrogate all forms of variation, including single-nucleotide variants, small insertion or deletion (indel) variants and structural variants. However, tools and resources for the study of structural variants have lagged behind those for smaller variants. Here we used a scalable pipeline1 to map and characterize structural variants in 17,795 deeply sequenced human genomes. We publicly release site-frequency data to create the largest, to our knowledge, whole-genome-sequencing-based structural variant resource so far. On average, individuals carry 2.9 rare structural variants that alter coding regions; these variants affect the dosage or structure of 4.2 genes and account for 4.0\textendash 11.2\% of rare high-impact coding alleles. Using a computational model, we estimate that structural variants account for 17.2\% of rare alleles genome-wide, with predicted deleterious effects that are equivalent to loss-of-function coding alleles; approximately 90\% of such structural variants are noncoding deletions (mean 19.1 per genome). We report 158,991 ultra-rare structural variants and show that 2\% of individuals carry ultra-rare megabase-scale structural variants, nearly half of which are balanced or complex rearrangements. Finally, we infer the dosage sensitivity of genes and noncoding elements, and reveal trends that relate to element class and conservation. This work will help to guide the analysis and interpretation of structural variants in the era of whole-genome sequencing.},

  abstract = {Sequence repeats are an important phenomenon in the human genome, playing important roles in genomic alteration often with phenotypic consequences. The two major types of repeat elements in the human genome are tandem repeats (TRs) including microsatellites, minisatellites, and satellites and transposable elements (TEs). So far, very little has been known about the relationship between these two types of repeats. In this study, we identified TRs that are derived from TEs either based on sequence similarity or overlapping genomic positions. We then analyzed the distribution of these TRs among TE families/subfamilies. Our study shows that at least 7,276\&\#x2009;TRs or 23\&\#x25; of all minisatellites/satellites is derived from TEs, contributing {$<$}italic{$>\&\#$}x7e;{$<$}/italic{$>$}0.32\&\#x25; of the human genome. TRs seem to be generated more likely from younger/more active TEs, and once initiated they are expanded with time via local duplication of the repeat units. The currently postulated mechanisms for origin of TRs can explain only 6\&\#x25; of all TE-derived TRs, indicating the presence of one or more yet to be identified mechanisms for the initiation of such repeats. Our result suggests that TEs are contributing to genome expansion and alteration not only by transposition but also by generating tandem repeats.},

  abstract = {Structural variants (SVs) underlie important crop improvement and domestication traits. However, resolving the extent, diversity, and quantitative impact of SVs has been challenging. We used long-read nanopore sequencing to capture 238,490 SVs in 100 diverse tomato lines. This panSV genome, along with 14 new reference assemblies, revealed large-scale intermixing of diverse genotypes, as well as thousands of SVs intersecting genes and cis-regulatory regions. Hundreds of SV-gene pairs exhibit subtle and significant expression changes, which could broadly influence quantitative trait variation. By combining quantitative genetics with genome editing, we show how multiple SVs that changed gene dosage and expression levels modified fruit flavor, size, and production. In the last example, higher order epistasis among four SVs affecting three related transcription factors allowed introduction of an important harvesting trait in modern tomato. Our findings highlight the underexplored role of SVs in genotype-to-phenotype relationships and their widespread importance and utility in crop improvement.},

Normalizing the data by filtering out the eigengenes (and eigenarrays) that are inferred to represent noise or experimental artifacts enables meaningful comparison of the expression of different genes across different arrays in different experiments. Sorting the data according to the eigengenes and eigenarrays gives a global picture of the dynamics of gene expression, in which individual genes and arrays appear to be classified into groups of similar regulation and function, or similar cellular state and biological phenotype, respectively. After normalization and sorting, the significant eigengenes and eigenarrays can be associated with observed genome-wide effects of regulators, or with measured samples, in which these regulators are overactive or underactive, respectively.},

Here, we investigate fine-scale population structure, history and consanguinity patterns using genetic and questionnaire data from \&gt;4,000 British Pakistani individuals, mostly with roots in Azad Kashmir and Punjab. We reveal strong recent population structure driven by the biraderi social stratification system. We find that all subgroups have had low effective population sizes (Ne) over the last 50 generations, with some showing a decrease in Ne 15-20 generations ago that has resulted in extensive identity-by-descent sharing and increased homozygosity. Using new theory, we show that the footprint of regions of homozygosity in the two largest subgroups is about twice that expected naively based on the self-reported consanguinity rates and the inferred historical Ne trajectory. These results demonstrate the impact of the cultural practices of endogamy and consanguinity on population structure and genomic diversity in British Pakistanis, and have important implications for medical genetic studies.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

In addition to this influx of assemblies from different species, new human de novo assemblies5 are being produced, which enable the analysis of not only small polymorphisms, but also complex, large-scale structural differences between human individuals and haplotypes. This coming era and its unprecedented amount of data offer the opportunity to uncover many insights into genome evolution but also present challenges in how to adapt current analysis methods to meet the increased scale. Cactus6, a reference-free multiple genome alignment program, has been shown to be highly accurate, but the existing implementation scales poorly with increasing numbers of genomes, and struggles in regions of highly duplicated sequences. Here we describe progressive extensions to Cactus to create Progressive Cactus, which enables the reference-free alignment of tens to thousands of large vertebrate genomes while maintaining high alignment quality. We describe results from an alignment of more than 600 amniote genomes, which is to our knowledge the largest multiple vertebrate genome alignment created so far.},

Several reviews of the psychological literature have shown that around 96\% of papers involving the use of null hypothesis significance testing report significant outcomes for their main results but that the typical studies are insufficiently powerful for such a track record. We explain this paradox by showing that the use of several small underpowered samples often represents a more efficient research strategy (in terms of finding p {$<$} .05) than does the use of one larger (more powerful) sample. Publication bias and the most efficient strategy lead to inflated effects and high rates of false positives, especially when researchers also resorted to questionable research practices, such as adding participants after intermediate testing. We provide simulations that highlight the severity of such biases in meta-analyses. We consider 13 meta-analyses covering 281 primary studies in various fields of psychology and find indications of biases and/or an excess of significant results in seven.

This algorithmic challenge has become particularly important with the emergence of long and accurate high-fidelity (HiFi) reads that were recently utilized to generate a semi-manual telomere-to-telomere assembly of the human genome using the alternative string graph assembly approach. To enable fully automated high-quality HiFi assemblies of various genomes, we developed an efficient jumboDB algorithm for constructing the de Bruijn graph for large genomes and large k-mer sizes and the LJA genome assembler that error-corrects HiFi reads and uses jumboDB to construct the de Bruijn graph on the error-corrected reads. Since the de Bruijn graph constructed for a fixed k-mer size is typically either too tangled or too fragmented, LJA uses a new concept of a multiplex de Bruijn graph with varying k-mer sizes. We demonstrate that LJA produces contiguous assemblies of complex repetitive regions in genomes including automated assemblies of various highly-repetitive human centromeres.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

  abstract = {In comparison to genotypes, knowledge about haplotypes (the combination of alleles present on a single chromosome) is much more useful for whole-genome association studies and for making inferences about human evolutionary history. Haplotypes are typically inferred from population genotype data using computational methods. Whole-genome sequence data represent a promising resource for constructing haplotypes spanning hundreds of kilobases for an individual. In this article, we propose a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm, HASH (haplotype assembly for single human), for assembling haplotypes from sequenced DNA fragments that have been mapped to a reference genome assembly. The transitions of the Markov chain are generated using min-cut computations on graphs derived from the sequenced fragments. We have applied our method to infer haplotypes using whole-genome shotgun sequence data from a recently sequenced human individual. The high sequence coverage and presence of mate pairs result in fairly long haplotypes (N50 length {$\sim$} 350 kb). Based on comparison of the sequenced fragments against the individual haplotypes, we demonstrate that the haplotypes for this individual inferred using HASH are significantly more accurate than the haplotypes estimated using a previously proposed greedy heuristic and a simple MCMC method. Using haplotypes from the HapMap project, we estimate the switch error rate of the haplotypes inferred using HASH to be quite low, {$\sim$}1.1\%. Our Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm represents a general framework for haplotype assembly that can be applied to sequence data generated by other sequencing technologies. The code implementing the methods and the phased individual haplotypes can be downloaded from http://www.cse.ucsd.edu/users/vibansal/HASH/.},

Due to splicing of an aberrant RNA driven by MAST2 promoter, but terminally processed using SVA polyadenylation signal, the first exon of MAST2 has fused to a spliced 3{${'}$}-terminal fragment of SVA retrotransposon. The above ancestor CpG-SVA element due to retrotranspositions of its own copies has formed a novel family represented in the human genome by 76 members. Recruitment of a MAST2 CpG island was most likely beneficial to the hybrid retrotransposons because it could significantly increase retrotransposition frequency. Also, we show that human L1 reverse transcriptase adds an extra cytosine residue to the 3{${'}$} terminus of the nascent first strand of cDNA.},

  abstract = {Dimensionality reduction is a common tool for visualization and inference of population structure from genotypes, but popular methods either return too many dimensions for easy plotting (PCA) or fail to preserve global geometry (t-SNE and UMAP). Here we explore the utility of variational autoencoders (VAEs) -- generative machine learning models in which a pair of neural networks seek to first compress and then recreate the input data -- for visualizing population genetic variation. VAEs incorporate non-linear relationships, allow users to define the dimensionality of the latent space, and in our tests preserve global geometry better than t-SNE and UMAP. Our implementation, which we call popvae, is available as a command-line python program at github.com/kr-colab/popvae. The approach yields latent embeddings that capture subtle aspects of population structure in humans and Anopheles mosquitoes, and can generate artificial genotypes characteristic of a given sample or population.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

The expansion of Alu elements is characterized by the dispersal, in a series of subfamilies, of elements of different evolutionary age that share common nucleotide substitutions. Alu elements have an impact on the genome in several ways, including insertion mutations, recombination between elements, gene conversion and gene expression. The human diseases caused by Alu insertions include neurofibromatosis, haemophilia, familial hypercholesterolaemia, breast cancer, insulin-resistant diabetes type II and Ewing sarcoma. Alu elements alter the distribution of methylation and, possibly, transcription of genes throughout the genome. The transcription of Alu elements changes in response to cellular stress and might be involved in maintaining or regulating the cellular stress response. Alu elements are a primary source for the origin of simple sequence repeats in primate genomes. Alu-insertion polymorphisms are a boon for the study of human population genetics and primate comparative genomics because they are neutral, identical-by-descent genetic markers with known ancestral states.},

  abstract = {High-throughput sequencing techniques generate large volumes of DNA sequencing data at ultra-fast speed and extremely low cost. As a consequence, sequencing techniques have become ubiquitous in biomedical research and are used in hundreds of genomic applications. Efficient data structures and algorithms have been developed to handle the large datasets produced by these techniques. The prevailing method to index DNA sequences in those data structures and algorithms is by k-mers (k-long substrings) known as minimizers. Minimizers are the smallest k-mers selected in every consecutive window of a fixed length in a sequence, where the smallest is determined according to a predefined order, e.g., lexicographic. Recently, a new k-mer order based on a universal hitting set (UHS) was suggested. While several studies have shown that orders based on a small UHS have improved properties, the utility of using a small UHS in high-throughput sequencing analysis tasks has not been demonstrated to date.Here, we demonstrate the practical benefit of UHSs for the first time, in the genome assembly task. Reconstructing a genome from billions of short reads is a fundamental task in high-throughput sequencing analyses. de Bruijn graph construction is a key step in genome assembly, which often requires very large amounts of memory and long computation time. A critical bottleneck lies in the partitioning of DNA sequences into bins. The sequences in each bin are assembled separately, and the final de Bruijn graph is constructed by merging the bin-specific subgraphs. We incorporated a UHS-based order in the bin partition step of the Minimum Substring Partitioning algorithm of Li et al. (2013). Using a UHS-based order instead of lexicographic- or random-ordered minimizers produced lower density minimizers with more balanced bin partitioning, which led to a reduction in both runtime and memory usage.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

  abstract = {Alu retrotransposons evolved from 7SL RNA approximately 65 million years ago and underwent several rounds of massive expansion in primate genomes. Consequently, the human genome currently harbors 1.1 million Alu copies. Some of these copies remain actively mobile and continue to produce both genetic variation and diseases by "jumping" to new genomic locations. However, it is unclear how many active Alu copies exist in the human genome and which Alu subfamilies harbor such copies. Here, we present a comprehensive functional analysis of Alu copies across the human genome. We cloned Alu copies from a variety of genomic locations and tested these copies in a plasmid-based mobilization assay. We show that functionally intact core Alu elements are highly abundant and far outnumber all other active transposons in humans. A range of Alu lineages were found to harbor such copies, including all modern AluY subfamilies and most AluS subfamilies. We also identified two major determinants of Alu activity: (1) The primary sequence of a given Alu copy, and (2) the ability of the encoded RNA to interact with SRP9/14 to form RNA/protein (RNP) complexes. We conclude that Alu elements pose the largest transposon-based mutagenic threat to the human genome. On the basis of our data, we have begun to identify Alu copies that are likely to produce genetic variation and diseases in humans.},

Most population and genome wide association studies have therefore been unable to consider variation in these regions. Core to the problem is the lack of a sequencing technology that produces reads with sufficient length and accuracy to enable unique mapping. Here we present a novel methodology of using read clouds, obtained by accurate short read sequencing of DNA derived from long fragment libraries, to confidently align short reads within repeat regions and enable accurate variant discovery. Our novel algorithm, Random Field Aligner (RFA), captures the relationships among the short reads governed by the long read process via a Markov Random Field. We utilized a modified version of the Illumina TruSeq synthetic long-read protocol, which yielded shallow-sequenced read clouds. We test RFA through extensive simulations and apply it to discover variants on the NA12878 human sample, for which shallow TruSeq read cloud sequencing data are available, and on an invasive breast carcinoma genome that we sequenced using the same method. We demonstrate that RFA facilitates accurate recovery of variation in 155Mb of the human genome, including 94\% of 67Mb of segmental duplication sequence and 96\% of 11Mb of transcribed sequence, that are currently hidden from short read technologies.},

By doing so, they can disrupt gene function and meiotic process, but also generate evolutionary novelties. It is however unclear how different processes such as varying rates of transposition, selection on TEs, linked selection and genome properties interact with each other. Here, we use the green anole (Anolis carolinensis) as a model, since it harbors one of the highest diversities of TEs found in a vertebrate (including non-LTR retrotransposons, LTR-Retrotransposons, DNA transposons and SINEs). By studying the population genomics of these different categories of TEs within the same species, we are able to disentangle processes that are specific to TE clades from general processes related to drift and selection. To do so, we use simulations of TEs in their genomic context to provide an interpretation of associations between recombination rate and statistics summarizing TE diversity and abundance. Our results highlight clear differences in TE dynamics across clades, with a clear dichotomy between SINEs/DNA-transposons and LTR-Retrotransposons/long LINEs. These differences can be mostly explained by changes in the relative impact of selection against TEs, linked selection, and insertional preferences.},

  abstract = {The incomplete identification of structural variants (SVs) from whole-genome sequencing data limits studies of human genetic diversity and disease association. Here, we apply a suite of long-read, short-read, and strand-specific sequencing technologies, optical mapping, and variant discovery algorithms to comprehensively analyze three human parent-child trios to define the full spectrum of human genetic variation in a haplotype-resolved manner. We identify 818,054 indel variants (\&lt;50 bp) and 27,622 SVs ({$>$}=50 bp) per human genome. We also discover 156 inversions per genome - most of which previously escaped detection. Fifty-eight of the inversions we discovered intersect with the critical regions of recurrent microdeletion and microduplication syndromes. Taken together, our SV callsets represent a sevenfold increase in SV detection compared to most standard high-throughput sequencing studies, including those from the 1000 Genomes Project. The method and the dataset serve as a gold standard for the scientific community and we make specific recommendations for maximizing structural variation sensitivity for future large-scale genome sequencing studies.},

Here, we present the results of a study examining genetic association between SVs and cardiometabolic traits in the Finnish population. We used sensitive methods to identify and genotype 129,166 high-confidence SVs from deep whole genome sequencing (WGS) data of 4,848 individuals. We tested the 64,572 common and low frequency SVs for association with 116 quantitative traits, and tested candidate associations using exome sequencing and array genotype data from an additional 15,205 individuals. We discovered 31 genome-wide significant associations at 15 loci, including two novel loci at which SVs have strong phenotypic effects: (1) a deletion of the ALB gene promoter that is greatly enriched in the Finnish population and causes decreased serum albumin level in carriers (p=1.47\texttimes 10-54), and is also associated with increased levels of total cholesterol (p=1.22\texttimes 10-28) and 14 additional cholesterol-related traits, and (2) a multiallelic copy number variant (CNV) at PDPR that is strongly associated with pyruvate (p=4.81\texttimes 10-21) and alanine (p=6.14\texttimes 10-12) levels and resides within a structurally complex genomic region that has accumulated many rearrangements over evolutionary time. We also confirmed six previously reported associations, including five led by stronger signals in single nucleotide variants (SNVs), and one linking recurrent HP gene deletion and cholesterol levels (p=6.24\texttimes 10-10), which was also found to be strongly associated with increased glycoprotein level (p=3.53\texttimes 10-35). Our study confirms that integrating SVs in trait-mapping studies will expand our knowledge of genetic factors underlying disease risk.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

However, it remains challenging to accurately detect the full spectrum of polymorphic (unfixed) ERVs using whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data.We designed a new tool, ERVcaller, to detect and genotype transposable element (TE) insertions, including ERVs, in the human genome. We evaluated ERVcaller using both simulated and real benchmark WGS datasets. Compared to existing tools, ERVcaller consistently obtained both the highest sensitivity and precision for detecting simulated ERV and other TE insertions derived from real polymorphic TE sequences. For the WGS data from the 1000 Genomes Project, ERVcaller detected the largest number of TE insertions per sample based on consensus TE loci. By analyzing the experimentally verified TE insertions, ERVcaller had 94.0\% TE detection sensitivity and 96.6\% genotyping accuracy. Polymerase chain reaction and Sanger sequencing in a small sample set verified 86.7\% of examined insertion statuses and 100\% of examined genotypes. In conclusion, ERVcaller is capable of detecting and genotyping TE insertions using WGS data with both high sensitivity and precision. This tool can be applied broadly to other species.http://www.uvm.edu/genomics/software/ERVcaller.html.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

We carried out high-resolution genetic, epigenetic, and transcriptomic profiling in three major human immune cell types (CD14+ monocytes, CD16+ neutrophils, and naive CD4+ T cells) from up to 197 individuals. We assess, quantitatively, the relative contribution of cis-genetic and epigenetic factors to transcription and evaluate their impact as potential sources of confounding in epigenome-wide association studies. Further, we characterize highly coordinated genetic effects on gene expression, methylation, and histone variation through quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping and allele-specific (AS) analyses. Finally, we demonstrate colocalization of molecular trait QTLs at 345 unique immune disease loci. This expansive, high-resolution atlas of multi-omics changes yields insights into cell-type-specific correlation between diverse genomic inputs, more generalizable correlations between these inputs, and defines molecular events that may underpin complex disease risk.},

For example, sequencing data of total genomic DNA show significant, yet unexpected enrichments on promoters and exons. This systematic bias is a particular problem for techniques such as chromatin immunoprecipitation, where the signal for a target factor is plotted across genomic features. We have focused on data obtained from Illumina's Genome Analyser platform, where at least three factors contribute to sequence bias: GC content, mappability of sequencing reads, and regional biases that might be generated by local structure. We show that relying on input control as a normalizer is not generally appropriate due to sample to sample variation in bias. To correct sequence bias, we present BEADS (bias elimination algorithm for deep sequencing), a simple three-step normalization scheme that successfully unmasks real binding patterns in ChIP-seq data. We suggest that this procedure be done routinely prior to data interpretation and downstream analyses.},

CRISPR-Cas9 deletion of a subset of these ERV elements in the human genome impaired expression of adjacent IFN-induced genes and revealed their involvement in the regulation of essential immune functions, including activation of the AIM2 inflammasome. Although these regulatory sequences likely arose in ancient viruses, they now constitute a dynamic reservoir of IFN-inducible enhancers fueling genetic innovation in mammalian immune defenses.},

These regulatory events at enhancers contribute to the specific gene expression programs that determine cell state and the potential for differentiation into new cell types. Although enhancer elements are known to be associated with certain histone modifications and transcription factors, the relationship of these modifications to gene expression and developmental state has not been clearly defined. Here we interrogate the epigenetic landscape of enhancer elements in embryonic stem cells and several adult tissues in the mouse. We find that histone H3K27ac distinguishes active enhancers from inactive/poised enhancer elements containing H3K4me1 alone. This indicates that the amount of actively used enhancers is lower than previously anticipated. Furthermore, poised enhancer networks provide clues to unrealized developmental programs. Finally, we show that enhancers are reset during nuclear reprogramming.},

We uncover 70,329,827 bases that are missing in the bovine linear reference genome. The missing sequences encode novel transcripts that are differentially expressed between individual animals.

  abstract = {Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by next-generation sequencing (ChIP-seq) has become the most widely used method to infer the genomic binding locations of chromatin-associated proteins such as histones and transcription factors. Since its emergence in 2007, ChIP-seq has been performed through a long sequence of manual steps, with consequent limitations in throughput and sensitivity of the technique. Here, we present a microfluidic implementation of the ChIP procedure, named FloChIP, which greatly streamlines the experimental workflow. We show that FloChIP can perform standard ChIP and sequential ChIP assays in parallel and reproducibly in an automated fashion for histone marks and transcription factors.Despite its popularity, chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq) remains a tedious (\&gt;2 d), manually intensive, low-sensitivity and low-throughput approach. Here, we combine principles of microengineering, surface chemistry, and molecular biology to address the major limitations of standard ChIP-seq. The resulting technology, FloChIP, automates and miniaturizes ChIP in a beadless fashion while facilitating the downstream library preparation process through on-chip chromatin tagmentation. FloChIP is fast (\&lt;2 h), has a wide dynamic range (from 106 to 500 cells), is scalable and parallelized, and supports antibody- or sample-multiplexed ChIP on both histone marks and transcription factors. In addition, FloChIP's interconnected design allows for straightforward chromatin reimmunoprecipitation, which allows this technology to also act as a microfluidic sequential ChIP-seq system. Finally, we ran FloChIP for the transcription factor MEF2A in 32 distinct human lymphoblastoid cell lines, providing insights into the main factors driving collaborative DNA binding of MEF2A and into its role in B cell-specific gene regulation. Together, our results validate FloChIP as a flexible and reproducible automated solution for individual or sequential ChIP-seq.},

The molecular biology techniques and the computational approaches to understand RBP-RNA (or ribonucleoprotein, RNP) interactions have advanced considerably over the past few years and numerous and diverse software tools have been developed to analyze these data. Accordingly, laboratories interested in RNP biology face the challenge of choosing adequately among the available software tools those that best address the biological problem they are studying. Here, we focus on state-of-the-art molecular biology techniques that employ crosslinking and immunoprecipitation (CLIP) of an RBP to study and map RNP interactions.

  abstract = {Motivation: Next-generation sequencing has become an important tool for genome-wide quantification of DNA and RNA. However, a major technical hurdle lies in the need to map short sequence reads back to their correct locations in a reference genome. Here, we investigate the impact of SNP variation on the reliability of read-mapping in the context of detecting allele-specific expression (ASE).Results: We generated 16 million 35 bp reads from mRNA of each of two HapMap Yoruba individuals. When we mapped these reads to the human genome we found that, at heterozygous SNPs, there was a significant bias toward higher mapping rates of the allele in the reference sequence, compared with the alternative allele. Masking known SNP positions in the genome sequence eliminated the reference bias but, surprisingly, did not lead to more reliable results overall. We find that even after masking, {$\sim$}5\textendash 10\% of SNPs still have an inherent bias toward more effective mapping of one allele. Filtering out inherently biased SNPs removes 40\% of the top signals of ASE. The remaining SNPs showing ASE are enriched in genes previously known to harbor cis-regulatory variation or known to show uniparental imprinting. Our results have implications for a variety of applications involving detection of alternate alleles from short-read sequence data.Availability: Scripts, written in Perl and R, for simulating short reads, masking SNP variation in a reference genome and analyzing the simulation output are available upon request from JFD.

Location: Small depressions (potholes) located on Mount St. Helens, Washington (46\textdegree 13{${'}$}51{${''}$}N, 122\textdegree 09{${'}$}10{${''}$}W, 1290 m). Methods: Pothole vegetation was described in 1993, 1997 and from 2001 to 2008. Explanatory variables included location and elevation (spatial factors), soil factors and Lupinus lepidus cover from prior years (a fertility surrogate). RDA assessed species-variable relationships. DCA calculated {$\beta$} diversity and within-year heterogeneity. Flexible sorting classified the vegetation. Species composition, richness, cover, H{${'}$} and evenness were also calculated. Results: Vegetation cover increased through 2001, and then fluctuated due to changes in L. lepidus cover. Richness peaked in 2005, after which pioneer species began to decline as persistent evergreen species increased. The six CTs recognized in 2008 were more scattered than were the six different CTs from 2001. DCA demonstrated that woody and rhizomatous species increased as pothole vegetation became less variable. RDA revealed weak spatial relationships in 1993, 1997 and 2001; thereafter, environmental and biological factors became important. The species-explanatory data relationship increased during this study from 10.2\% to 36.0\%, leaving 64.0\% of the variation unexplained. Conclusions: This is the first temporal study to demonstrate that deterministic control of vegetation development increases during succession. Pothole vegetation has converged somewhat due to deterministic factors, but the initial effects of chance, local disturbances and history remain large and may prevent strong convergence.},

  abstract = {High-throughput sequencing technologies produce short sequence reads that can contain phase information if they span two or more heterozygote genotypes. This information is not routinely used by current methods that infer haplotypes from genotype data. We have extended the SHAPEIT2 method to use phase-informative sequencing reads to improve phasing accuracy. Our model incorporates the read information in a probabilistic model through base quality scores within each read. The method is primarily designed for high-coverage sequence data or data sets that already have genotypes called. One important application is phasing of single samples sequenced at high coverage for use in medical sequencing and studies of rare diseases. Our method can also use existing panels of reference haplotypes. We tested the method by using a mother-father-child trio sequenced at high-coverage by Illumina together with the low-coverage sequence data from the 1000 Genomes Project (1000GP). We found that use of phase-informative reads increases the mean distance between switch errors by 22\% from 274.4 kb to 328.6 kb. We also used male chromosome X haplotypes from the 1000GP samples to simulate sequencing reads with varying insert size, read length, and base error rate. When using short 100~bp paired-end reads, we found that using mixtures of insert sizes produced the best results. When using longer reads with high error rates (5?20 kb read with 4\%?15\% error per base), phasing performance was substantially improved.},

Here we develop a method to estimate haplotypes from low-coverage sequencing data that can take advantage of single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) microarray genotypes on the same samples. First the SNP array data are phased to build a backbone (or `scaffold') of haplotypes across each chromosome. We then phase the sequence data `onto' this haplotype scaffold. This approach can take advantage of relatedness between sequenced and non-sequenced samples to improve accuracy. We use this method to create a new 1000GP haplotype reference set for use by the human genetic community. Using a set of validation genotypes at SNP and bi-allelic indels we show that these haplotypes have lower genotype discordance and improved imputation performance into downstream GWAS samples, especially at low-frequency variants.},

  abstract = {Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) is a disruptive technology that has found widespread acceptance in the life sciences research community. The high throughput and low cost of sequencing has encouraged researchers to undertake ambitious genomic projects, especially in de novo genome sequencing. Currently, NGS systems generate sequence data as short reads and de novo genome assembly using these short reads is computationally very intensive. Due to lower cost of sequencing and higher throughput, NGS systems now provide the ability to sequence genomes at high depth. However, currently no report is available highlighting the impact of high sequence depth on genome assembly using real data sets and multiple assembly algorithms. Recently, some studies have evaluated the impact of sequence coverage, error rate and average read length on genome assembly using multiple assembly algorithms, however, these evaluations were performed using simulated datasets. One limitation of using simulated datasets is that variables such as error rates, read length and coverage which are known to impact genome assembly are carefully controlled. Hence, this study was undertaken to identify the minimum depth of sequencing required for de novo assembly for different sized genomes using graph based assembly algorithms and real datasets. Illumina reads for E.coli (4.6 MB) S.kudriavzevii (11.18 MB) and C.elegans (100 MB) were assembled using SOAPdenovo, Velvet, ABySS, Meraculous and IDBA-UD. Our analysis shows that 50X is the optimum read depth for assembling these genomes using all assemblers except Meraculous which requires 100X read depth. Moreover, our analysis shows that de novo assembly from 50X read data requires only 6\textendash 40 GB RAM depending on the genome size and assembly algorithm used. We believe that this information can be extremely valuable for researchers in designing experiments and multiplexing which will enable optimum utilization of sequencing as well as analysis resources.},

Using marked Alu sequences in an ex vivo assay, we previously showed that they are mobilized through diversion of the LINE (Long INterspersed Elements) retrotransposition machinery, with the poly(A) tail of the Alu being required for their mobility. Here we show that other homopolymeric tracts cannot functionally replace the Alu poly(A) tail, and that the Alu transposition rate varies over a two-log range depending on the poly(A) tail length. Variation is according to a sigmoid-shaped curve with a lag observed for tails shorter than 15 nt and a plateau reached for tails longer than 50 nt, consistent with the binding of a limited number of a protein component requiring multiple contacts for a productive interaction with the poly(A) stretch. This analysis indicates that most of the naturally occurring genomic Alu, owing to their pA tail length, should be poor substrates for the LINE machinery, a feature possibly ``selected'' for the host sake.},

The Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) project has systematically mapped regions of transcription, transcription factor association, chromatin structure and histone modification. These data enabled us to assign biochemical functions for 80\% of the genome, in particular outside of the well-studied protein-coding regions. Many discovered candidate regulatory elements are physically associated with one another and with expressed genes, providing new insights into the mechanisms of gene regulation. The newly identified elements also show a statistical correspondence to sequence variants linked to human disease, and can thereby guide interpretation of this variation. Overall, the project provides new insights into the organization and regulation of our genes and genome, and is an expansive resource of functional annotations for biomedical research.},

  abstract = {The spatial and temporal regulation of transcription initiation is pivotal for controlling gene expression. Here, we introduce capped-small RNA-seq (csRNA-seq), which uses total RNA as starting material to detect transcription start sites (TSSs) of both stable and unstable RNAs at single-nucleotide resolution. csRNA-seq is highly sensitive to acute changes in transcription and identifies an order of magnitude more regulated transcripts than does RNA-seq. Interrogating tissues from species across the eukaryotic kingdoms identified unstable transcripts resembling enhancer RNAs, pri-miRNAs, antisense transcripts, and promoter upstream transcripts in multicellular animals, plants, and fungi spanning 1.6 million years of evolution. Integration of epigenomic data from these organisms revealed that histone H3 trimethylation (H3K4me3) was largely confined to TSSs of stable transcripts, whereas H3K27ac marked nucleosomes downstream from all active TSSs, suggesting an ancient role for posttranslational histone modifications in transcription. Our findings show that total RNA is sufficient to identify transcribed regulatory elements and capture the dynamics of initiated stable and unstable transcripts at single-nucleotide resolution in eukaryotes.},

We generated deep, whole-genome sequence data of 17 individuals in a three-generation pedigree and called variants in each genome using a range of currently available algorithms. We used haplotype transmission information to create a phased ``Platinum'' variant catalog of 4.7 million single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) plus 0.7 million small (1\textendash 50 bp) insertions and deletions (indels) that are consistent with the pattern of inheritance in the parents and 11 children of this pedigree. Platinum genotypes are highly concordant with the current catalog of the National Institute of Standards and Technology for both SNVs ({$>$}99.99\%) and indels (99.92\%) and add a validated truth catalog that has 26\% more SNVs and 45\% more indels. Analysis of 334,652 SNVs that were consistent between informatics pipelines yet inconsistent with haplotype transmission (``nonplatinum'') revealed that the majority of these variants are de novo and cell-line mutations or reside within previously unidentified duplications and deletions. The reference materials from this study are a resource for objective assessment of the accuracy of variant calls throughout genomes.},

  abstract = {Typical analysis workflows map reads to a reference genome in order to detect genetic variants. Generating such alignments introduces references biases, in particular against insertion alleles absent in the reference and comes with substantial computational burden. In contrast, recent k-mer-based genotyping methods are fast, but struggle in repetitive or duplicated regions of the genome. We propose a novel algorithm, called PanGenie, that leverages a pangenome reference built from haplotype-resolved genome assemblies in conjunction with k-mer count information from raw, short-read sequencing data to genotype a wide spectrum of genetic variation. The given haplotypes enable our method to take advantage of linkage information to aid genotyping in regions poorly covered by unique k-mers and provides access to regions otherwise inaccessible by short reads. Compared to classic mapping-based approaches, our approach is more than 4x faster at 30x coverage and at the same time, reached significantly better genotype concordances for almost all variant types and coverages tested. Improvements are especially pronounced for large insertions (\&gt; 50bp), where we are able to genotype \&gt; 99.9\% of all tested variants with over 90\% accuracy at 30x short-read coverage, where the best competing tools either typed less than 60\% of variants or reached accuracies below 70\%. PanGenie now enables the inclusion of this commonly neglected variant type in downstream analyses.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

Using a target-centered functional screen, we matched murine TEs with their cognate KRAB-ZFP. We found the paralogs ZFP932 and Gm15446 to bind overlapping but distinguishable subsets of ERVK (endogenous retrovirus K), repress these elements in embryonic stem cells, and regulate secondarily the expression of neighboring genes. Most importantly, we uncovered that these KRAB-ZFPs and KAP1 control TEs in adult tissues, in cell culture and in~vivo, where they partner up to modulate cellular genes. Therefore, TEs and KRAB-ZFPs establish transcriptional networks that likely regulate not only development but also many physiological events. Given the~high degree of species specificity of TEs and KRAB-ZFPs, these results have important implications for understanding the biology of higher vertebrates, including humans.},

Syncmers are an alternative method for selecting a subset of k-mers. Unlike a minimizer, a syncmer is identified by its k-mer sequence alone and is therefore synchronized in the following sense: if a given k-mer is selected from one sequence, it will also be selected from any other sequence. Bounded syncmers are defined by a small and fast function of the k-mer sequence which exploits correlations between overlapping k-mers to guarantee that at least one syncmer must appear in a window of predetermined length, and therefore comprise a universal hitting set which does not require a precomputed lookup table. Bounded syncmers are shown to be unambiguously superior to minimizers because they achieve both lower density and better conservation in mutated sequences.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

The contigs were aligned to recently published catalogs of Icelandic and Pan-African NSs, as well as the chimpanzee genome, revealing a great diversity of shared sequences. Analyzing the positioning of NS across the chimpanzee genome, we find that 2,807 NS align confidently within 143 chimpanzee orthologs of human genes. Aligning the whole genome sequencing data to the chimpanzee genome, we discover ancestral NS common throughout the Swedish population. The NSs were searched for repeats and repeat elements: revealing a majority of repetitive sequence (56\%), and enrichment of simple repeats (28\%) and satellites (15\%). Lastly, we align the unmappable reads of a subset of the thousand genomes data to our collection of NS, as well as the previously published Pan-African NS: revealing that both the Swedish and Pan-African NS are widespread, and that the Swedish NSs are largely a subset of the Pan-African NS. Overall, these results highlight the importance of creating a more diverse reference genome and illustrate that significant amounts of the NS may be of ancestral origin.},

However, implementing and correctly using this data model can be difficult, and the scale of pangenomic data sets can be challenging to work at. These challenges have impeded progress in this field.Here we present a stack of two C\,++ libraries, libbdsg and libhandlegraph, which use a simple, field-proven interface, designed to expose elementary features of these graphs while preventing common graph manipulation mistakes. The libraries also provide a Python binding. Using a diverse collection of pangenome graphs, we demonstrate that these tools allow for efficient construction and manipulation of large genome graphs with dense variation. For instance, the speed and memory usage is up to an order of magnitude better than the prior graph implementation in the VG toolkit, which has now transitioned to using libbdsg's implementations.libhandlegraph and libbdsg are available under an MIT License from https://github.com/vgteam/libhandlegraph and https://github.com/vgteam/libbdsg.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

  abstract = {A major challenge in understanding gene regulation is the unequivocal identification of enhancer elements and uncovering their connections to genes. We present GeneHancer, a novel database of human enhancers and their inferred target genes, in the framework of GeneCards. First, we integrated a total of 434 000 reported enhancers from four different genome-wide databases: the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE), the Ensembl regulatory build, the functional annotation of the mammalian genome (FANTOM) project and the VISTA Enhancer Browser. Employing an integration algorithm that aims to remove redundancy, GeneHancer portrays 285 000 integrated candidate enhancers (covering 12.4\% of the genome), 94 000 of which are derived from more than one source, and each assigned an annotation-derived confidence score. GeneHancer subsequently links enhancers to genes, using: tissue co-expression correlation between genes and enhancer RNAs, as well as enhancer-targeted transcription factor genes; expression quantitative trait loci for variants within enhancers; and capture Hi-C, a promoter-specific genome conformation assay. The individual scores based on each of these four methods, along with gene\textendash enhancer genomic distances, form the basis for GeneHancer's combinatorial likelihood-based scores for enhancer\textendash gene pairing. Finally, we define `elite' enhancer\textendash gene relations reflecting both a high-likelihood enhancer definition and a strong enhancer\textendash gene association. GeneHancer predictions are fully integrated in the widely used GeneCards Suite, whereby candidate enhancers and their annotations are displayed on every relevant GeneCard. This assists in the mapping of non-coding variants to enhancers, and via the linked genes, forms a basis for variant\textendash phenotype interpretation of whole-genome sequences in health and disease.

  abstract = {As a result of millions of years of transposon activity, multiple rounds of ancient polyploidization, and large populations that preserve diversity, maize has an extremely structurally diverse genome, evidenced by high-quality genome assemblies that capture substantial levels of both tropical and temperate diversity. We generated a pangenome representation (the Practical Haplotype Graph, PHG) of these assemblies in a database, representing the pangenome haplotype diversity and providing an initial estimate of structural diversity. We leveraged the pangenome to accurately impute haplotypes and genotypes of taxa using various kinds of sequence data, ranging from WGS to extremely-low coverage GBS. We imputed the genotypes of the recombinant inbred lines of the NAM population with over 99\% mean accuracy, while unrelated germplasm attained a mean imputation accuracy of 92 or 95\% when using GBS or WGS data, respectively. Most of the imputation errors occur in haplotypes within European or tropical germplasm, which have yet to be represented in the maize PHG database. Also, the PHG stores the imputation data in a 30,000-fold more space-efficient manner than a standard genotype file, which is a key improvement when dealing with large scale data.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

  abstract = {Large genomic structural variants ({$>$}50bp) are important contributors to disease, yet they remain one of the most difficult types of variation to accurately ascertain, in part because they tend to cluster in duplicated and repetitive regions, but also because the various signals for these events can be challenging to detect with short reads. Clinically, aCGH and karyotype remain the most commonly used assays for genome-wide structural variant (SV) detection, though there is clear potential benefit to an NGS-based assay that accurately detects both SVs and single nucleotide variants. Linked-Read sequencing is a relatively simple, fast, and cost-effective method that is applicable to both genome and targeted assays. Linked-Reads are generated by performing haplotype-level dilution of long input DNA molecules into {$>$}1 million barcoded partitions, generating barcoded short reads within those partitions, and then performing short read sequencing in bulk. We performed 30x Linked-Read genome sequencing on a set of 23 samples with known balanced or unbalanced SVs. Twenty-seven of the 29 known events were detected and another event was called as a candidate. Sequence downsampling was performed on a subset to determine the lowest sequence depth required to detect variations. Copy-number variants can be called with as little as 1-2x sequencing depth (5-10Gb) while balanced events require on the order of 10x coverage for variant calls to be made, although specific signal is clearly present at 1-2x sequencing depth. In addition to detecting a full spectrum of variant types with a single test, Linked-Read sequencing provides base-level resolution of breakpoints, enabling complete resolution of even the most complex chromosomal rearrangements.},

Therefore, MEIs should be fully discovered along with other forms of genetic variation in whole genome sequencing (WGS) projects involving population genetics, human diseases, and clinical genomics. Here, we describe the Mobile Element Locator Tool (MELT), which was developed as part of the 1000 Genomes Project to perform MEI discovery on a population scale. Using both Illumina WGS data and simulations, we demonstrate that MELT outperforms existing MEI discovery tools in terms of speed, scalability, specificity, and sensitivity, while also detecting a broader spectrum of MEI-associated features. Several run modes were developed to perform MEI discovery on local and cloud systems. In addition to using MELT to discover MEIs in modern humans as part of the 1000 Genomes Project, we also used it to discover MEIs in chimpanzees and ancient (Neanderthal and Denisovan) hominids. We detected diverse patterns of MEI stratification across these populations that likely were caused by (1) diverse rates of MEI production from source elements, (2) diverse patterns of MEI inheritance, and (3) the introgression of ancient MEIs into modern human genomes. Overall, our study provides the most comprehensive map of MEIs to date spanning chimpanzees, ancient hominids, and modern humans and reveals new aspects of MEI biology in these lineages. We also demonstrate that MELT is a robust platform for MEI discovery and analysis in a variety of experimental settings.},

Simulation studies using data from the UK Biobank show that PRS-CS outperforms existing methods across a wide range of genetic architectures, especially when the training sample size is large.

It produces precise estimates of repeated DNA content and TE consensus sequences, as well as the relative ages of TE families. We shows that dnaPipeTE performs well using very low coverage sequencing in different genomes, losing accuracy only with old TE families. We applied this pipeline to the genome of the Asian tiger mosquito Aedes albopictus, an invasive species of human health interest, for which the genome size is estimated to be over 1 Gbp. Using dnaPipeTE, we showed that this species harbors a large (50\% of the genome) and potentially active repeatome with an overall TE class and order composition similar to that of Aedes aegypti, the yellow fever mosquito. However, intraorder dynamics show clear distinctions between the two species, with differences at the TE family level. Our pipeline's ability to manage the repeatome annotation problem will make it helpful for new or ongoing assembly projects, and our results will benefit future genomic studies of A. albopictus.},

Predicting the statistical properties of the final sample based on preliminary data can be challenging, because numerous uncertain model assumptions may be involved. Here, we ask whether we can predict "omics" variation across many samples by sequencing only a fraction of them. In the infinite-genome limit, we find that a pilot study sequencing 5\% of a population is sufficient to predict the number of genetic variants in the entire population within 6\% of the correct value, using an estimator agnostic to demography, selection, or population structure. To reach similar accuracy in a finite genome with millions of polymorphisms, the pilot study would require {$\sim$}15\% of the population. We present computationally efficient jackknife and linear programming methods that exhibit substantially less bias than the state of the art when applied to simulated data and subsampled 1000 Genomes Project data. Extrapolating based on the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute Exome Sequencing Project data, we predict that 7.2\% of sites in the capture region would be variable in a sample of 50,000 African Americans and 8.8\% in a European sample of equal size. Finally, we show how the linear programming method can also predict discovery rates of various genomic features, such as the number of transcription factor binding sites across different cell types.},

Given their length and repetitive nature, telomeric regions are not easily reconstructed from short read sequencing, making telomere sequence resolution a very costly and generally intractable problem. Recently, long-read sequencing, with read lengths measuring in hundreds of Kbp, has made it possible to routinely read into telomeric regions and inspect their structure. Here, we describe a framework for extracting telomeric reads from single-molecule sequencing experiments, describing their sequence variation and motifs, and for haplotype inference. We find that long telomeric stretches can be accurately captured with long-read sequencing, observe extensive sequence heterogeneity of human telomeres, discover and localize non-canonical motifs (both previously reported as well as novel), and report the first motif composition maps of human telomeric diplotypes on a multi-Kbp scale.},

Currently available tools allow de novo assembly of graph-based reference genomes, alignment of new read sets to the graph representation as well as certain analyses like variant-calling.

The method is a graph generalization of the peak caller MACS2 and is implemented in an open source tool, Graph Peak Caller. By using the existing tool vg to build a pan-genome of Arabidopsis thaliana, we validate our approach by showing that Graph Peak Caller with a pan-genome reference graph can trace variants within peaks that are not part of the linear reference genome, and find peaks that in general are more motif-enriched than those found by MACS2.},

Combined expression and T cell antigen receptor based lineage tracking revealed a significant proportion of inter-tissue effector T cells with a highly migratory nature. As well as tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells undergoing exhaustion, we observed two clusters of cells exhibiting states preceding exhaustion, and a high ratio of '' pre-exhausted'' to exhausted T cells was associated with better prognosis of lung adenocarcinoma. Additionally, we observed further heterogeneity within the tumor regulatory T cells (Tregs), characterized by the bimodal distribution of TNFRSF9, an activation marker for antigen-specific Tregs. The gene signature of those activated tumor Tregs, which included IL1R2, correlated with poor prognosis in lung adenocarcinoma. Our study provides a new approach for patient stratification and will help further understand the functional states and dynamics of T cells in lung cancer.},

We sought to identify potential susceptibility genes by integrating the risk variants at these regions with genetic variants impacting gene expression and splicing of nearby genes. We compiled gene expression and genotyping data from 2,169 samples for 6 different HGSOC-relevant tissue types. We integrated these data with GWAS data from 13,037 HGSOC cases and 40,941 controls, and performed a transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS) across \&gt;70,000 significantly heritable gene/exon features. We identified 24 transcriptome-wide significant associations for 14 unique genes, plus 90 significant exon-level associations in 20 unique genes. We implicated multiple novel genes at risk loci, e.g. LRRC46 at 19q21.32 (TWAS P=1\texttimes 10-9) and a PRC1 splicing event (TWAS P=9\texttimes 10-8) which was splice-variant specific and exhibited no eQTL signal. Functional analyses in HGSOC cell lines found evidence of essentiality for GOSR2, INTS1, KANSL1 and PRC1; with the latter gene showing levels of essentiality comparable to that of MYC. Overall, gene expression and splicing events explained 41\% of SNP-heritability for HGSOC (s.e. 11\%, P=2.5\texttimes 10-4), implicated at least one target gene for 6/13 distinct genome-wide significant regions and revealed 2 known and 26 novel candidate susceptibility genes for HGSOC.STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE For many ovarian cancer risk regions, the target genes regulated by germline genetic variants are unknown. Using expression data from \&gt;2,100 individuals, this study identified novel associations of genes and splicing variants with ovarian cancer risk; with transcriptional variation now explaining over one-third of the SNP-heritability for this disease.},

We developed an efficient method for calculating the expected distribution of genetic variation, given a demographic model including such events as population size changes, population splits and joins, and migration. We applied our approach to publicly available human sequencing data, searching for models that best reproduce the observed patterns. Our joint analysis of data from African, European, and Asian populations yielded new dates for when these populations diverged. In particular, we found that African and Eurasian populations diverged around 100,000 years ago. This is earlier than other genetic studies suggest, because our model includes the effects of migration, which we found to be important for reproducing observed patterns of variation in the data. We also analyzed data from European, Asian, and Mexican populations to model the peopling of the Americas. Here, we find no evidence for recurrent migration after East Asian and Native American populations diverged. Our methods are not limited to studying humans, and we hope that future sequencing projects will offer more insights into the history of both our own species and others.},

This paper examined 258,050 test results across 30,710 articles from eight high impact journals to investigate the existence of a peculiar prevalence of p-values just below .05 (i.e., a bump) in the psychological literature, and a potential increase thereof over time. We indeed found evidence for a bump just below .05 in the distribution of exactly reported p-values in the journals Developmental Psychology, Journal of Applied Psychology, and Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, but the bump did not increase over the years and disappeared when using recalculated p-values. We found clear and direct evidence for the QRP "incorrect rounding of p-value" (John, Loewenstein \& Prelec, 2012) in all psychology journals. Finally, we also investigated monotonic excess of p-values, an effect of certain QRPs that has been neglected in previous research, and developed two measures to detect this by modeling the distributions of statistically significant p-values. Using simulations and applying the two measures to the retrieved test results, we argue that, although one of the measures suggests the use of QRPs in psychology, it is difficult to draw general conclusions concerning QRPs based on modeling of p-value distributions.},

Although their mobilization can constitute a threat to genome integrity, nearly half of modern mammalian genomes are composed of remnants of TE insertions. The first critical step for a successful transposition cycle is the generation of a full-length transcript. TEs have evolved cis-regulatory elements enabling them to recruit host-encoded factors driving their own, selfish transcription. TEs are generally transcriptionally silenced in somatic cells, and the mechanisms underlying their repression have been extensively studied. However, during germline formation, preimplantation development, and tumorigenesis, specific TE families are highly expressed. Understanding the molecular players at stake in these contexts is of utmost importance to establish the mechanisms regulating TEs, as well as the importance of their transcription to the biology of the host. Here, we review the transcription factors known to be involved in the sequence-specific recognition and transcriptional activation of specific TE families or subfamilies. We discuss the diversity of TE regulatory elements within mammalian genomes and highlight the importance of TE mobilization in the dispersal of transcription factor-binding sites over the course of evolution.},

Still, thousands of SVs have been characterized, and catalogs continue to improve with new technologies. In parallel, variation graphs have been proposed to represent human pangenomes, offering reduced reference bias and better mapping accuracy than linear reference genomes. We contend that variation graphs provide an effective means for leveraging SV catalogs for short-read SV genotyping experiments. In this work, we extend vg (a software toolkit for working with variation graphs) to support SV genotyping. We show that it is capable of genotyping insertions, deletions and inversions, even in the presence of small errors in the location of the SVs breakpoints. We then benchmark vg against state-of-the-art SV genotypers using three high-quality sequence-resolved SV catalogs generated by recent studies ranging up to 97,368 variants in size. We find that vg systematically produces the best genotype predictions in all datasets. In addition, we use assemblies from 12 yeast strains to show that graphs constructed directly from aligned de novo assemblies can improve genotyping compared to graphs built from intermediate SV catalogs in the VCF format. Our results demonstrate the power of variation graphs for SV genotyping. Beyond single nucleotide variants and short insertions/deletions, the vg toolkit now incorporates SVs in its unified variant calling framework and provides a natural solution to integrate high-quality SV catalogs and assemblies.},

  abstract = {Author Summary Large association studies have proven to be effective tools for identifying parts of the genome that influence disease risk and other heritable traits. So-called ``genotype imputation'' methods form a cornerstone of modern association studies: by extrapolating genetic correlations from a densely characterized reference panel to a sparsely typed study sample, such methods can estimate unobserved genotypes with high accuracy, thereby increasing the chances of finding true associations. To date, most genome-wide imputation analyses have used reference data from the International HapMap Project. While this strategy has been successful, association studies in the near future will also have access to additional reference information, such as control sets genotyped on multiple SNP chips and dense genome-wide haplotypes from the 1,000 Genomes Project. These new reference panels should improve the quality and scope of imputation, but they also present new methodological challenges. We describe a genotype imputation method, IMPUTE version 2, that is designed to address these challenges in next-generation association studies. We show that our method can use a reference panel containing thousands of chromosomes to attain higher accuracy than is possible with the HapMap alone, and that our approach is more accurate than competing methods on both current and next-generation datasets. We also highlight the modeling issues that arise in imputation datasets.},

The initial release of Dfam, featured in the 2013 NAR Database Issue, contained 1143 families of repetitive elements found in humans, and was used to produce more than 100 Mb of additional annotation of TE-derived regions in the human genome, with improved speed. Here, we describe recent advances, most notably expansion to 4150 total families including a comprehensive set of known repeat families from four new organisms (mouse, zebrafish, fly and nematode). We describe improvements to coverage, and to our methods for identifying and reducing false annotation. We also describe updates to the website interface. The Dfam website has moved to http://dfam.org. Seed alignments, profile HMMs, hit lists and other underlying data are available for download.},

  abstract = {With the development of High-Throughput Sequencing (HTS) thousands of human genomes have now been sequenced. Whenever different studies analyze the same genome they usually agree on the amount of single-nucleotide polymorphisms, but differ dramatically on the number of insertion and deletion variants (indels). Furthermore, there is evidence that indels are often severely under-reported. In this manuscript we derive the total number of indel variants in a human genome by combining data from different sequencing technologies, while assessing the indel detection accuracy. Our estimate of approximately 1 million indels in a Yoruban genome is much higher than the results reported in several recent HTS studies. We identify two key sources of difficulties in indel detection: the insufficient coverage, read length or alignment quality; and the presence of repeats, including short interspersed elements and homopolymers/dimers. We quantify the effect of these factors on indel detection. The quality of sequencing data plays a major role in improving indel detection by HTS methods. However, many indels exist in long homopolymers and repeats, where their detection is severely impeded. The true number of indel events is likely even higher than our current estimates, and new techniques and technologies will be required to detect them.},

Here we report generating a p53 R178C knockin mouse modeling the human TP53 R181C mutation, which is notable for its prevalence and prior molecular characterization. Consistent with its weak cancer penetrance in~humans, homozygous p53178C/C mice show a modest increase in tumorigenesis but, surprisingly, are lean with decreased body fat content. They display evidence of increased lipolysis and upregulation of fatty acid metabolism in their inguinal white adipose tissue (iWAT). Gene expression and chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) analyses show that the mutant p53 bound and transactivated Beta-3-Adrenergic Receptor (ADRB3), a gene that is known to promote lipolysis and is associated with obesity. This study reveals that a germline mutation of p53 can affect fat metabolism, which has been implicated in cancer development.},

Specifically, we examined correlations among the geographic location of sampling plots separated by either 135\textendash 3515 m (mesoscale) or 4\textendash 134 m (fine scale), the abiotic environmental characteristics of the plots, and their constituent fern species. Ferns had predictable distributions along a soil moisture gradient at both spatial scales: six of eight common fern species showed repeatable environmental optima along the soil moisture gradient. By sampling in such a way as to decouple the correlation between distance and environmental variation, we showed the dominant role of environmental variables such as soil moisture in determining fern distributions at the mesoscale. At the fine scale, however, strong spatial autocorrelation in the abiotic environment precluded assigning any definitive role for either dispersal or environmental determinism alone in affecting fern distributions. The expectations of neutral theory that are rooted in dispersal limitation and those of niche theory that are rooted in environmental adaptation converge at fine spatial scales where natural environments have strong spatial structure. The structure of the environment at fine spatial scales may foster the persistence of dispersal-limited plants in the community; neighboring environments are likely to be similar, and thus suitable for propagules dispersing short distances. While patterns of fern distribution in this locality are not consistent with purely neutral or random models of species coexistence, alternative models that rely on strict niche requirements without accounting for dispersal effects and the inherent spatial structure of the environment are inadequate because they neglect the important interaction of these factors. This outcome supports the relevance of developing theory that considers the joint effects of environmental determinism and dispersal on the distribution and abundance of plant species.},

From whole-genome sequence alignments, 344 large ({$>$}100-kb) blocks of conserved synteny are evident, but these are further fragmented by smaller-scale evolutionary events. Excluding transposon insertions, on average in each megabase of genomic alignment we observe two inversions, 17 duplications (five tandem or nearly tandem), seven transpositions, and 200 deletions of 100 bases or more. This includes 160 inversions and 75 duplications or transpositions of length {$>$}100 kb. The frequencies of these smaller events are not substantially higher in finished portions in the assembly. Many of the smaller transpositions are processed pseudogenes; we define a '' syntenic'' subset of the alignments that excludes these and other small-scale transpositions. These alignments provide evidence that {$\approx$}2\% of the genes in the human/mouse common ancestor have been deleted or partially deleted in the mouse. There also appears to be slightly less nontransposon-induced genome duplication in the mouse than in the human lineage. Although some of the events we detect are possibly due to misassemblies or missing data in the current genome sequence or to the limitations of our methods, most are likely to represent genuine evolutionary events. To make these observations, we developed new alignment techniques that can handle large gaps in a robust fashion and discriminate between orthologous and paralogous alignments.},

We have developed an accurate and efficient novel method for discovery of samples-specific strings between two groups of WGS samples. The proposed approach will give us the ability to perform comparative genome analysis without the need to map the reads and is not hindered by shortcomings of the reference genome. We show that the proposed approach is capable of accurately finding samples-specific strings representing nearly all variation (\&gt; 98\%) reported across pairs or trios of WGS samples using accurate long reads (e.g., PacBio HiFi data).Availability The proposed tool is publicly available at https://github.com/Parsoa/PingPong.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

Among them is Alu element which is the most abundant element, composing \textasciitilde 10\% of the human genome. The element emerged in the primate genome 65 million years ago and has since propagated successfully in the human and non-human primate genomes. Alu element is a non-autonomous retrotransposon and therefore retrotransposed using L1-enzyme machinery. The 'master gene' model has been generally accepted to explain Alu element amplification in primate genomes. According to the model, different subfamilies of Alu elements are created by mutations on the master gene and most Alu elements are amplified from the hyperactive master genes. Alu element is frequently involved in genomic rearrangements in the human genome due to its abundance and sequence identity between them. The genomic rearrangements caused by Alu elements could lead to genetic disorders such as hereditary disease, blood disorder, and neurological disorder. In fact, Alu elements are associated with approximately 0.1\% of human genetic disorders. The first part of this review discusses mechanisms of Alu amplification and diversity among different Alu subfamilies. The second part discusses the particular role of Alu elements in generating genomic rearrangements as well as human genetic disorders.},

  abstract = {The goal of the 1000 Genomes Consortium is to characterize human genome structural variation (SV), including forms of copy number variations such as deletions, duplications, and insertions. Mobile element insertions, particularly Alu elements, are major contributors to genomic SV among humans. During the pilot phase of the project we experimentally validated 645 (611 intergenic and 34 exon targeted) polymorphic ``young'' Alu insertion events, absent from the human reference genome. Here, we report high resolution sequencing of 343 (322 unique) recent Alu insertion events, along with their respective target site duplications, precise genomic breakpoint coordinates, subfamily assignment, percent divergence, and estimated A-rich tail lengths. All the sequenced Alu loci were derived from the AluY lineage with no evidence of retrotransposition activity involving older Alu families (e.g., AluJ and AluS). AluYa5 is currently the most active Alu subfamily in the human lineage, followed by AluYb8, and many others including three newly identified subfamilies we have termed AluYb7a3, AluYb8b1, and AluYa4a1. This report provides the structural details of 322 unique Alu variants from individual human genomes collectively adding about 100 kb of genomic variation. Many Alu subfamilies are currently active in human populations, including a surprising level of AluY retrotransposition. Human Alu subfamilies exhibit continuous evolution with potential drivers sprouting new Alu lineages.},

  abstract = {Background In high-throughput studies, hundreds to millions of hypotheses are typically tested. Statistical methods that control the false discovery rate (FDR) have emerged as popular and powerful tools for error rate control. While classic FDR methods use only p-values as input, more modern FDR methods have been shown to increase power by incorporating complementary information as ``informative covariates'' to prioritize, weight, and group hypotheses. However, there is currently no consensus on how the modern methods compare to one another. We investigated the accuracy, applicability, and ease of use of two classic and six modern FDR-controlling methods by performing a systematic benchmark comparison using simulation studies as well as six case studies in computational biologyResults Methods that incorporate informative covariates were modestly more powerful than classic approaches, and did not underperform classic approaches, even when the covariate was completely uninformative. The majority of methods were successful at controlling the FDR, with the exception of two modern methods under certain settings. Furthermore, we found the improvement of the modern FDR methods over the classic methods increased with the informativeness of the covariate, total number of hypothesis tests, and proportion of truly non-null hypotheses.Conclusions Modern FDR methods that use an informative covariate provide advantages over classic FDR-controlling procedures, with the relative gain dependent on the application and informativeness of available covariates. We present our findings as a practical guide and provide recommendations to aid researchers in their choice of methods to correct for false discoveries.},

Sentiment Analysis on IMDb movie reviews identifies the overall sentiment or opinion expressed by a reviewer towards a movie. Many researchers are working on pruning the sentiment analysis model that clearly identifies and distinguishes between a positive review and a negative review. In the proposed work, we show that the use of Hybrid features obtained by concatenating Machine Learning features (TF, TF-IDF) with Lexicon features (Positive-Negative word count, Connotation) gives better results both in terms of accuracy and complexity when tested against classifiers like SVM, Na\"ive Bayes, KNN and Maximum Entropy. The proposed model clearly differentiates between a positive review and negative review. Since understanding the context of the reviews plays an important role in classification, using hybrid features helps in capturing the context of the movie reviews and hence increases the accuracy of classification.},

  abstract = {Motivation: Eugene Myers in his string graph paper suggested that in a string graph or equivalently a unitig graph, any path spells a valid assembly. As a string/unitig graph also encodes every valid assembly of reads, such a graph, provided that it can be constructed correctly, is in fact a lossless representation of reads. In principle, every analysis based on whole-genome shotgun sequencing (WGS) data, such as SNP and insertion/deletion (INDEL) calling, can also be achieved with unitigs.Results: To explore the feasibility of using de novo assembly in the context of resequencing, we developed a de novo assembler, fermi, that assembles Illumina short reads into unitigs while preserving most of information of the input reads. SNPs and INDELs can be called by mapping the unitigs against a reference genome. By applying the method on 35-fold human resequencing data, we showed that in comparison to the standard pipeline, our approach yields similar accuracy for SNP calling and better results for INDEL calling. It has higher sensitivity than other de novo assembly based methods for variant calling. Our work suggests that variant calling with de novo assembly can be a beneficial complement to the standard variant calling pipeline for whole-genome resequencing. In the methodological aspects, we propose FMD-index for forward\textendash backward extension of DNA sequences, a fast algorithm for finding all super-maximal exact matches and one-pass construction of unitigs from an FMD-index.Availability:http://github.com/lh3/fermiContact:hengli@broadinstitute.org},

A first generation of hash table-based methods has been developed, including MAQ, which is accurate, feature rich and fast enough to align short reads from a single individual. However, MAQ does not support gapped alignment for single-end reads, which makes it unsuitable for alignment of longer reads where indels may occur frequently. The speed of MAQ is also a concern when the alignment is scaled up to the resequencing of hundreds of individuals. RESULTS: We implemented Burrows-Wheeler Alignment tool (BWA), a new read alignment package that is based on backward search with Burrows-Wheeler Transform (BWT), to efficiently align short sequencing reads against a large reference sequence such as the human genome, allowing mismatches and gaps. BWA supports both base space reads, e.g. from Illumina sequencing machines, and color space reads from AB SOLiD machines. Evaluations on both simulated and real data suggest that BWA is approximately 10-20x faster than MAQ, while achieving similar accuracy. In addition, BWA outputs alignment in the new standard SAM (Sequence Alignment/Map) format. Variant calling and other downstream analyses after the alignment can be achieved with the open source SAMtools software package. AVAILABILITY: http://maq.sourceforge.net.},

Despite the large number of SNPs assessed in each study, the effects of most common SNPs must be evaluated indirectly using either genotyped markers or haplotypes thereof as proxies. We have previously implemented a computationally efficient Markov Chain framework for genotype imputation and haplotyping in the freely available MaCH software package. The approach describes sampled chromosomes as mosaics of each other and uses available genotype and shotgun sequence data to estimate unobserved genotypes and haplotypes, together with useful measures of the quality of these estimates. Our approach is already widely used to facilitate comparison of results across studies as well as meta-analyses of GWAS. Here, we use simulations and experimental genotypes to evaluate its accuracy and utility, considering choices of genotyping panels, reference panel configurations, and designs where genotyping is replaced with shotgun sequencing. Importantly, we show that genotype imputation not only facilitates cross study analyses but also increases power of genetic association studies. We show that genotype imputation of common variants using HapMap haplotypes as a reference is very accurate using either genome-wide SNP data or smaller amounts of data typical in fine-mapping studies. Furthermore, we show the approach is applicable in a variety of populations. Finally, we illustrate how association analyses of unobserved variants will benefit from ongoing advances such as larger HapMap reference panels and whole genome shotgun sequencing technologies.

The model overcomes limitations of existing approaches to understanding, summarizing, and interpreting LD by (i) relating patterns of LD directly to the underlying recombination process; (ii) considering all loci simultaneously, rather than pairwise; (iii) avoiding the assumption that LD necessarily has a ``block-like'' structure; and (iv) being computationally tractable for huge genomic regions (up to complete chromosomes). We examine in detail one natural application of the model: estimation of underlying recombination rates from population data. Using simulation, we show that in the case where recombination is assumed constant across the region of interest, recombination rate estimates based on our model are competitive with the very best of current available methods. More importantly, we demonstrate, on real and simulated data, the potential of the model to help identify and quantify fine-scale variation in recombination rate from population data. We also outline how the model could be useful in other contexts, such as in the development of more efficient haplotype-based methods for LD mapping.},

  abstract = {A key mutational process in cancer is structural variation, in which rearrangements delete, amplify or reorder genomic segments that range in size from kilobases to whole chromosomes1\textendash 7. Here we develop methods to group, classify and describe somatic structural variants, using data from the Pan-Cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes (PCAWG) Consortium of the International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), which aggregated whole-genome sequencing data from 2,658~cancers across 38~tumour types8. Sixteen signatures of structural variation emerged. Deletions have a multimodal size distribution, assort unevenly across tumour types and patients, are enriched in late-replicating regions and correlate with inversions. Tandem duplications also have a multimodal size distribution, but are enriched in early-replicating regions\textemdash as are unbalanced translocations. Replication-based mechanisms of rearrangement generate varied chromosomal structures with low-level copy-number gains and frequent inverted rearrangements. One prominent structure consists of 2\textendash 7~templates copied from distinct regions of the genome strung together within one locus. Such cycles of templated insertions correlate with tandem duplications, and\textemdash in liver cancer\textemdash frequently activate the telomerase gene TERT. A wide variety of rearrangement processes are active in cancer, which generate complex configurations of the genome upon which selection can act.},

  abstract = {RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) is currently the standard method for genome-wide gene expression profiling. RNA-seq reads often need to be mapped to a reference genome before read counts can be produced for genes. Read trimming methods have been developed to assist read mapping by removing adapter sequences and low-sequencing-quality bases. It is however unclear what is the impact of read trimming on the quantification of RNA-seq gene expression, an important task in the analysis of RNA-seq data. In this study, we used a benchmark RNA-seq dataset generated in the SEQC project to assess the impact of read trimming on mapping and quantification of RNA-seq reads. We found that adapter sequences can be effectively removed by the read aligner via its `soft-clipping' procedure and many low-sequencing-quality bases, which would be removed by read trimming tools, were rescued by the aligner. Accuracy of gene expression quantification from using untrimmed reads was found to be comparable to or slightly better than that from using trimmed reads, based on expression of \&gt;900 genes measured by real-time PCR. Total data analysis time was reduced by up to an order of magnitude when read trimming was not performed. Our study suggests that read trimming is a redundant process in the quantification of RNA-seq expression data.},

  abstract = {Author summary Human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6) infects most people during childhood and can reactivate later in life to contribute to diseases. The HHV-6 genome is also inherited by about 1\% of people, included in the end ``cap'' of one of their 46 chromosomes. Little is known about how HHV-6 genomes entered human genomes, whether or not they still do, and the risk this poses for virus reactivation. We looked for HHV-6 in genome sequences from \textasciitilde 7,500 Japanese people. Most integrated HHV-6 variants have been co-evolving with human chromosomes for many generations. Surprisingly, in almost three-fourths of Japanese people with HHV-6 in their genome, HHV-6 is integrated in the same end of the same chromosome \textendash{} 22q. Persistence of the HHV-6 genome within the short ``cap'' that preserves the end of chromosome 22q raises the question of whether the integrated viral sequence has taken on a useful function for this chromosome. Some human genomes harbor only one part of the HHV-6 genome\textendash the same part that remains after experimental HHV-6 reactivation, during which most of the virus is cut out of the genome. This suggests that integration of HHV-6 into inherited human genomes is not irreversible, and possibly leads to production of infectious virus.},

TCGA clinical data contain key features representing the democratized nature of the data collection process. To ensure proper use of this large clinical dataset associated with genomic features, we developed a standardized dataset named the TCGA Pan-Cancer Clinical Data Resource (TCGA-CDR), which includes four major clinical outcome endpoints. In addition to detailing major challenges and statistical limitations encountered during the effort of integrating the acquired clinical data, we present a summary that includes endpoint usage recommendations for each cancer type.

In this study, we performed individual de novo genome assemblies for 26 representative soybeans that were selected from 2,898 deeply sequenced accessions. Using these assembled genomes together with three previously reported genomes, we constructed a graph-based genome and performed pan-genome analysis, which identified numerous genetic variations that cannot be detected by direct mapping of short sequence reads onto a single reference genome. The structural variations from the 2,898 accessions that were genotyped based on the graph-based genome and the RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data from the representative 26 accessions helped to link genetic variations to candidate genes that are responsible for important traits. This pan-genome resource will promote evolutionary and functional genomics studies in soybean.},

Here we introduce single-cell variational inference (scVI), a ready-to-use scalable framework for the probabilistic representation and analysis of gene expression in single cells (https://github.com/YosefLab/scVI). scVI uses stochastic optimization and deep neural networks to aggregate information across similar cells and genes and to approximate the distributions that underlie observed expression values, while accounting for batch effects and limited sensitivity. We used scVI for a range of fundamental analysis tasks including batch correction, visualization, clustering, and differential expression, and achieved high accuracy for each task.},

Here we describe the algorithms and implementation of BlastFrost. We also present two exemplar practical applications. In the first, we determined the presence of the individual genes within the SPI-2 Salmonella pathogenicity island within a collection of 926 representative genomes in minutes. In the second application, we determined the existence of known single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with fluoroquinolone resistance in the genes gyrA, gyrB and parE among 190, 209 Salmonella genomes.

In many workflows, each of the short sequences (``reads'') resulting from a sequencing run are first ``mapped'' (aligned) to a reference sequence to infer the read from which the genomic location derived, a challenging task because of the high data volumes and often large genomes. Existing read mapping software excel in either speed (e.g., BWA, Bowtie, ELAND) or sensitivity (e.g., Novoalign), but not in both. In addition, performance often deteriorates in the presence of sequence variation, particularly so for short insertions and deletions (indels). Here, we present a read mapper, Stampy, which uses a hybrid mapping algorithm and a detailed statistical model to achieve both speed and sensitivity, particularly when reads include sequence variation. This results in a higher useable sequence yield and improved accuracy compared to that of existing software.},

  abstract = {The contemporary literature accepts that disturbance strongly influences patterns of species diversity, and that the relationship is peaked, with a maximum at intermediate levels of disturbance. We tested this hypothesis using a compilation of published species diversity\textendash disturbance relationships that were gleaned from a literature search of papers published from 1985 through 1996 and from references therein. We identified 116 species richness\textendash, 53 diversity\textendash, and 28 evenness\textendash disturbance relationships in the literature, which we grouped according to shape of relationship (nonsignificant, peaked, negative monotonic, positive monotonic, or U-shaped). We tested the relationships between the strength and shapes of these relationships and attributes of the community, disturbance, and sampling and study design. Nonsignificant relationships were the most common, comprising 35\% of richness, 28\% of diversity, and 50\% of evenness studies. Peaked responses were reported in only 16\% of richness, 19\% of diversity, and 11\% of evenness cases. Explained variation in the three measures of diversity was variable among studies but averaged {$\sim$}50\%. It was higher when few samples and few disturbance levels were examined and when organisms within the samples were not exhaustively censused, suggesting that procedural artifact contributes to these relationships. Explained variation was also higher in studies in which disturbance was measured as a gradient of time passed since the last disturbance (meanr2 = 61\%), vs. studies of spatial variation in richness (meanr2 = 42\%). Peaked richness relationships had the greatest odds of being observed when sampled area and actual evapotranspiration were small, when disturbances were natural rather than anthropogenic in origin, and when few disturbance levels were examined. Thus, on average, diversity\textendash disturbance relationships do not have consistently highr2 and are not as consistently peaked as the contemporary consensus would suggest.},

We introduce a probabilistic framework that models correlation among transcriptome-wide association study signals to assign a probability for every gene in the risk region to explain the observed association signal. Importantly, our approach remains accurate when expression data for causal genes are not available in the causal tissue by leveraging expression prediction from other tissues. Our approach yields credible sets of genes containing the causal gene at a nominal confidence level (for example, 90\%) that can be used to prioritize genes for functional assays. We illustrate our approach by using an integrative analysis of lipid traits, where our approach prioritizes genes with strong evidence for causality.},

Toward this goal, in the last few years several computational approaches have been introduced to index and query large collections of data sets.

Current advances in sequencing technologies press for the development of faster pairwise alignment algorithms that can scale with increasing read lengths and production yields.In this paper, we present the wavefront alignment algorithm (WFA), an exact gap-affine algorithm that takes advantage of homologous regions between the sequences to accelerate the alignment process. As opposed to traditional dynamic programming algorithms that run in quadratic time, the WFA runs in time O(ns), proportional to the read length n and the alignment score s, using O(s2) memory. Furthermore, our algorithm exhibits simple data dependencies that can be easily vectorized, even by the automatic features of modern compilers, for different architectures, without the need to adapt the code. We evaluate the performance of our algorithm, together with other state-of-the-art implementations. As a result, we demonstrate that the WFA runs 20-300x faster than other methods aligning short Illumina-like sequences, and 10-100x faster using long noisy reads like those produced by Oxford Nanopore Technologies.The WFA algorithm is implemented within the wavefront-aligner library, and it is publicly available at https://github.com/smarco/WFA},

  abstract = {Large-scale population based analyses coupled with advances in technology have demonstrated that the human genome is more diverse than originally thought. Standard short-read approaches, used primarily due to accuracy, throughput and costs, fail to give a complete picture of a genome. They struggle to identify large, balanced structural events, cannot access repetitive regions of the genome and fail to resolve the human genome into its two haplotypes. Here we describe an approach that retains long range information while harnessing the power of short reads. Starting from only \textasciitilde{} ng of DNA, we produce barcoded short read libraries. The use of novel informatic approaches allows for the barcoded short reads to be associated with the long molecules of origin producing a novel datatype known as `Linked-Reads'. This approach allows for simultaneous detection of small and large variants from a single Linked-Read library. We have previously demonstrated the utility of whole genome Linked-Reads (lrWGS) for performing diploid, de novo assembly of individual genomes (Weisenfeld et al. ). In this manuscript, we show the utility of reference based analysis using a single Linked-Read library for full spectrum genome analysis. We demonstrate the ability of Linked-Reads to reconstruct megabase scale haplotypes and to recover parts of the genome that are typically inaccessible to short reads, including phenotypically important genes such as STRC, SMN and SMN . We demonstrate the ability of both lrWGS and Linked-Read Whole Exome Sequencing (lrWES) to identify complex structural variations, including balanced events, single exon deletions, and single exon duplications. The data presented here show that Linked-Reads provide a scalable approach for comprehensive genome analysis that is not possible using short reads alone.},

However, the massive data sets generated by NGS--the 1000 Genome pilot alone includes nearly five terabases--make writing feature-rich, efficient, and robust analysis tools difficult for even computationally sophisticated individuals. Indeed, many professionals are limited in the scope and the ease with which they can answer scientific questions by the complexity of accessing and manipulating the data produced by these machines. Here, we discuss our Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK), a structured programming framework designed to ease the development of efficient and robust analysis tools for next-generation DNA sequencers using the functional programming philosophy of MapReduce. The GATK provides a small but rich set of data access patterns that encompass the majority of analysis tool needs. Separating specific analysis calculations from common data management infrastructure enables us to optimize the GATK framework for correctness, stability, and CPU and memory efficiency and to enable distributed and shared memory parallelization. We highlight the capabilities of the GATK by describing the implementation and application of robust, scale-tolerant tools like coverage calculators and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) calling. We conclude that the GATK programming framework enables developers and analysts to quickly and easily write efficient and robust NGS tools, many of which have already been incorporated into large-scale sequencing projects like the 1000 Genomes Project and The Cancer Genome Atlas.},

  abstract = {Motivation Emerging Linked-Read (aka read-cloud) technologies such as the 10x Genomics Chromium system have great potential for accurate detection and phasing of largescale human genome structural variations (SVs). By leveraging the long-range information encoded in Linked-Read sequencing, computational techniques are able to detect and characterize complex structural variations that are previously undetectable by short-read methods. However, there is no available Linked-Read method for detection and assembly of novel sequence insertions, DNA sequences present in a given sequenced sample but missing in the reference genome, without requiring whole genome de novo assembly. In this paper, we propose a novel integrated alignment-based and local-assembly-based algorithm, Novel-X, that effectively uses the barcode information encoded in Linked-Read sequencing datasets to improve detection of such events without the need of whole genome de novo assembly. We evaluated our method on two haploid human genomes, CHM1 and CHM13, sequenced on the 10x Genomics Chromium system. These genomes have been also characterized with high coverage PacBio long-reads recently. We also tested our method on NA12878, the wellknown HapMap CEPH diploid genome and the child genome in a Yoruba trio (NA19240) which was recently studied on multiple sequencing platforms. Detecting insertion events is very challenging using short reads and the only viable available solution is by long-read sequencing (e.g. PabBio or ONT). Our experiments, however, show that Novel-X finds many insertions that cannot be found by state of the art tools using short-read sequencing data but present in PacBio data. Since Linked-Read sequencing is significantly cheaper than long-read sequencing, our method using Linked-Reads enables routine large-scale screenings of sequenced genomes for novel sequence insertions.Availability Software is freely available at https://github.com/1dayac/novel\_insertionsContact imh2003\{at\}med.cornell.eduSupplementary information Supplementary data are available at https://github.com/1dayac/novel\_insertions\_supplementary},

Here we present a de novo human genome assembly that surpasses the continuity of GRCh382, along with the first gapless, telomere-to-telomere assembly of a human chromosome. This was enabled by high-coverage, ultra-long-read nanopore sequencing of the complete hydatidiform mole CHM13 genome, combined with complementary technologies for quality improvement and validation. Focusing our efforts on the human X chromosome3, we reconstructed the \textasciitilde 3.1 megabase centromeric satellite DNA array and closed all 29 remaining gaps in the current reference, including new sequence from the human pseudoautosomal regions and cancer-testis ampliconic gene families (CT-X and GAGE). These novel sequences will be integrated into future human reference genome releases.

A first step in the analysis of RNA-seq data is the alignment of short sequence reads to a common reference genome or transcriptome. Genetic variants that distinguish individual genomes from the reference sequence can cause reads to be misaligned, resulting in biased estimates of transcript abundance. Fine-tuning of read alignment algorithms does not correct this problem. We have developed Seqnature software to construct individualized diploid genomes and transcriptomes for multiparent populations and have implemented a complete analysis pipeline that incorporates other existing software tools. We demonstrate in simulated and real data sets that alignment to individualized transcriptomes increases read mapping accuracy, improves estimation of transcript abundance, and enables the direct estimation of allele-specific expression. Moreover, when applied to expression QTL mapping we find that our individualized alignment strategy corrects false-positive linkage signals and unmasks hidden associations. We recommend the use of individualized diploid genomes over reference sequence alignment for all applications of high-throughput sequencing technology in genetically diverse populations.},

Adding this missing variation results in a structure that can be described as a mathematical graph: a genome graph. We demonstrate that, in comparison to the existing reference genome (GRCh38), genome graphs can substantially improve the fractions of reads that map uniquely and perfectly. Furthermore, we show that this fundamental simplification of read mapping transforms the variant calling problem from one in which many non-reference variants must be discovered de-novo to one in which the vast majority of variants are simply re-identified within the graph. Using standard benchmarks as well as a novel reference-free evaluation, we show that a simplistic variant calling procedure on a genome graph can already call variants at least as well as, and in many cases better than, a state-of-the-art method on the linear human reference genome. We anticipate that graph-based references will supplant linear references in humans and in other applications where cohorts of sequenced individuals are available.},

Recent genome assembly projects have relied on a combination of noisy long-read sequencing and accurate short-read sequencing, with the former offering greater assembly continuity and the latter providing higher consensus accuracy. The recently introduced PacBio HiFi sequencing technology bridges this divide by delivering long reads ({$>$}10 kbp) with high per-base accuracy ({$>$}99.9\%). Here we present HiCanu, a modification of the Canu assembler designed to leverage the full potential of HiFi reads via homopolymer compression, overlap-based error correction, and aggressive false overlap filtering. We benchmark HiCanu with a focus on the recovery of haplotype diversity, major histocompatibility complex (MHC) variants, satellite DNAs, and segmental duplications. For diploid human genomes sequenced to 30\texttimes{} HiFi coverage, HiCanu achieved superior accuracy and allele recovery compared to the current state of the art. On the effectively haploid CHM13 human cell line, HiCanu achieved an NG50 contig size of 77 Mbp with a per-base consensus accuracy of 99.999\% (QV50), surpassing recent assemblies of high-coverage, ultra-long Oxford Nanopore reads in terms of both accuracy and continuity. This HiCanu assembly correctly resolves 337 out of 341 validation BACs sampled from known segmental duplications and provides the first preliminary assemblies of 9 complete human centromeric regions. Although gaps and errors still remain within the most challenging regions of the genome, these results represent a significant advance towards the complete assembly of human genomes.},

Modern genotyping technologies do not measure haplotypes directly, but the combined sum (or genotype) of alleles at each site. Statistical methods are needed to infer (or phase) the haplotypes from the observed genotypes. Haplotype estimation is a key first step of many disease and population genetic studies. Much recent work in this area has focused on phasing in cohorts of nominally unrelated individuals. So called `long range phasing' is a relatively recent concept for phasing individuals with intermediate levels of relatedness, such as cohorts taken from population isolates. Methods also exist for phasing genotypes for individuals within explicit pedigrees. Whilst high quality phasing techniques are available for each of these demographic scenarios, to date, no single method is applicable to all three. In this paper, we present a general approach for phasing cohorts that contain any level of relatedness between the study individuals. We demonstrate high levels of accuracy in all demographic scenarios, as well as the ability to detect (Mendelian consistent) genotyping error and recombination events in duos and trios, the first method with such a capability.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Short read DNA sequencing technologies have revolutionized genome assembly by providing high accuracy and throughput data at low cost. But it remains challenging to assemble short read data, particularly for large, complex and polyploid genomes. The linked read strategy has the potential to enhance the value of short reads for genome assembly because all reads originating from a single long molecule of DNA share a common barcode. However, the majority of studies to date that have employed linked reads were focused on human haplotype phasing and genome assembly. RESULTS: Here we describe a de novo maize B73 genome assembly generated via linked read technology which contains \textasciitilde\,172,000 scaffolds with an N50 of 89~kb that cover 50\% of the genome. Based on comparisons to the B73 reference genome, 91\% of linked read contigs are accurately assembled. Because it was possible to identify errors with {$>$}\,76\% accuracy using machine learning, it may be possible to identify and potentially correct systematic errors. Complex polyploids represent one of the last grand challenges in genome assembly. Linked read technology was able to successfully resolve the two subgenomes of the recent allopolyploid, proso millet (Panicum miliaceum). Our assembly covers \textasciitilde\,83\% of the 1 Gb genome and consists of 30,819 scaffolds with an N50 of 912~kb. CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis provides a framework for future de novo genome assemblies using linked reads, and we suggest computational strategies that if implemented have the potential to further improve linked read assemblies, particularly for repetitive genomes.},

Then, a sequence-specific simulation tool estimates the residual mapping bias. Statistical tests for allelic imbalance are provided that can be used with the bias corrected RNA-seq data.},

In genome assembly and genetics, the possible paths through a superbubble can be considered to represent the set of possible sequences at a location in a genome. Bidirected and biedged graphs are a generalization of digraphs that are increasingly being used to more fully represent genome assembly and variation problems. In this study, we define snarls and ultrabubbles, generalizations of superbubbles for bidirected and biedged graphs, and give an efficient algorithm for the detection of these more general structures. Key to this algorithm is the cactus graph, which, we show, encodes the nested decomposition of a graph into snarls and ultrabubbles within its structure. We propose and demonstrate empirically that this decomposition on bidirected and biedged graphs solves a fundamental problem by defining genetic sites for any collection of genomic variations, including complex structural variations, without need for any single reference genome coordinate system. Further, the nesting of the decomposition gives a natural way to describe and model variations contained within large variations, a case not currently dealt with by existing formats [e.g., variant cell format (VCF)].},

However, representing more than three datasets while keeping the proportions of each region is still not feasible with existing tools.We present an algorithm to render all the regions of a generalized n-dimensional Venn diagram, while keeping the area of each region approximately proportional to the number of elements included. In addition, missing regions in Euler diagrams lead to simplified representations. The algorithm generates an n-dimensional Venn diagram and inserts circles of given areas in each region. Then, the diagram is rearranged with a dynamic, self-correcting simulation in which each set border is contracted until it contacts the circles inside.

While metabolism-related genes were shown to be enriched with Alu, in structural genes Alu elements are under-represented. Such observations led researchers to suggest that Alu elements were involved in gene regulation and were selected to be present in some genes and absent from others. This hypothesis is gaining strength due to findings that indicate involvement of Alu elements in a variety of functions; for example, Alu sequences were found to contain several functional transcription factor (TF) binding sites (BSs). We performed a search for new putative BSs on Alu elements, using a database of Position Specific Score Matrices (PSSMs). We searched consensus Alu sequences as well as specific Alu elements that appear on the 5 Kbp regions upstream to the transcription start site (TSS) of about 14000 genes.},

Structural variations incorporated into a graph genome can be genotyped accurately under a unified framework.

This analysis confirmed that the formation of each subfamily can be explained by the sequential accumulation of mutations relative to the previous subfamily. Polymerase chain reaction amplification of orthologous loci in several primate species allowed us to determine the time of insertion of Alu sequences in individual loci. These data suggest that the vast majority of Alu elements amplified at any given time comprised a single Alu subfamily. We find that, although the individual divergence relative to a consensus sequence correlate reasonably well with sequence age, the diagnostic mutations are a more accurate measure of the age of any individual Alu family member. Our data are consistent with a model in which all Alu family members have been made from a single master gene or from a series of sequential master genes. This master gene(s) accumulated diagnostic base changes, resulting in the amplification of different subfamilies from the master gene at different times in primate evolution. The changes in the master gene(s) probably occurred individually, but their appearance is clearly punctuated. Ten of them have occurred within an {$\sim$}15-million-year time span, 40\textendash 25 million years ago, and 8 changes have occurred within the last 5 million years.

A dominant method of such string matching is the `seed-and-extend' approach, in which occurrences of short subsequences called `seeds' are used to search for potentially longer matches in a large database of sequences. Each such potential match is then checked to see if it extends beyond the seed. To be effective, the seed-and-extend approach needs to catalogue seeds from virtually every substring in the database of search strings. Projects such as mammalian genome assemblies and large-scale protein matching, however, have such large sequence databases that the resulting list of seeds cannot be stored in RAM on a single computer. This significantly slows the matching process.Results: We present a simple and elegant method in which only a small fraction of seeds, called `minimizers', needs to be stored. Using minimizers can speed up string-matching computations by a large factor while missing only a small fraction of the matches found using all seeds.},

Specifically, 34\% of published array-based GWAS studies for a variety of diseases utilize probes that overlap unanticipated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), indels, or structural variants. Linkage disequilibrium (LD) block length depends on the numbers of markers used, and the mean LD block size decreases from 16 kb to 7 kb,when HapMap-based calculations are compared to blocks computed from1KGP data. Additionally, when 1KGP and CG variants are compared, 19\% of the single nucleotide variants (SNVs) reported from common genomes are unique to one dataset; likely a result of differences in data collection methodology, alignment of reads to the reference genome, and variant-calling algorithms.

  abstract = {To study allele-specific expression (ASE) and binding (ASB), that is, differences between the maternally and paternally derived alleles, we have developed a computational pipeline (AlleleSeq). Our pipeline initially constructs a diploid personal genome sequence (and corresponding personalized gene annotation) using genomic sequence variants (SNPs, indels, and structural variants), and then identifies allele-specific events with significant differences in the number of mapped reads between maternal and paternal alleles. There are many technical challenges in the construction and alignment of reads to a personal diploid genome sequence that we address, for example, bias of reads mapping to the reference allele. We have applied AlleleSeq to variation data for NA12878 from the 1000 Genomes Project as well as matched, deeply sequenced RNA-Seq and ChIP-Seq data sets generated for this purpose. In addition to observing fairly widespread allele-specific behavior within individual functional genomic data sets (including results consistent with X-chromosome inactivation), we can study the interaction between ASE and ASB. Furthermore, we investigate the coordination between ASE and ASB from multiple transcription factors events using a regulatory network framework. Correlation analyses and network motifs show mostly coordinated ASB and ASE.},

  abstract = {In contrast to genome assemblers that use de Bruijn graphs, those based on string graphs are able to losslessly retain information from sequence data. However, despite the advantages provided by a string graph framework in repeat detection and in maintaining read coherence, the high computational cost for constructing a string graph hinders its usability for genome assembly. Even though different algorithms have been proposed over the last decade for string graph construction, efficiency is still a challenge due to the demand for processing a large amount of sequence data generated by Next-Generation Sequencing technologies. In this paper, we provide a novel, linear time and alphabet-size-independent algorithm SOF which uses the property of irreducible edges and transitive edges to efficiently construct a string graph from an overlap graph. Experimental results show that SOF is at least 2.3 times faster than the string graph construction algorithm provided in SGA (one of the most popular string graph-based assemblers), while maintaining almost the same memory footprint as SGA. Moreover, the implementation of SOF as a subprogram in the SGA assembly pipeline will allow a user easy access to the preprocessing and postprocessing steps for genome assembly provided in SGA.

We show that NucleoATAC can identify the rotational and translational positions of nucleosomes with up to base-pair resolution and provide quantitative measures of nucleosome occupancy in S. cerevisiae, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, and human cells. We demonstrate the application of NucleoATAC to a number of outstanding problems in chromatin biology, including analysis of sequence features underlying nucleosome positioning, promoter chromatin architecture across species, identification of transient changes in nucleosome occupancy and positioning during a dynamic cellular response, and integrated analysis of nucleosome occupancy and transcription factor binding.},

However, many methods are unable to align reads to much of the genome, recognized as important in disease, and thus report erroneous results in downstream analyses. We introduce EMA, a novel two-tiered statistical binning model for barcoded read alignment, that first probabilistically maps reads to potentially multiple ``read clouds'' and then within clouds by newly exploiting the non-uniform read densities characteristic of barcoded read sequencing. EMA substantially improves downstream accuracy over existing methods, including phasing and genotyping on 10x data, with fewer false variant calls in nearly half the time. EMA effectively resolves particularly challenging alignments in genomic regions that contain nearby homologous elements, uncovering variants in the pharmacogenomically important CYP2D region, and clinically important genes C4 (schizophrenia) and AMY1A (obesity), which go undetected by existing methods. Our work provides a framework for future generation sequencing.},

By sampling a diverse set of individuals, one can begin to assemble a pan-genome: a collection of all the DNA sequences that occur in a species. Here we review efforts to create pan-genomes for a range of species, from bacteria to humans, and we further consider the computational methods that have been proposed in order to capture, interpret and compare pan-genome data. As scientists continue to survey and catalogue the genomic variation across human populations and begin to assemble a human pan-genome, these efforts will increase our power to connect variation to human diversity, disease and beyond.},

Improving predictions may be dependent on expanding the set of bona fide TF binding alterations. Allele-specific binding (ASB) events, where TFs preferentially bind to one of the two alleles at heterozygous sites, reveal the impact of sequence variations in altered TF binding. Here, we present the largest ASB compilation to our knowledge, 10 765 ASB events retrieved from 45 ENCODE ChIP-Seq data sets. Our analysis showed that ASB events were frequently associated with motif alterations of the ChIP'ed TF and potential partner TFs, allelic difference of DNase I hypersensitivity and allelic difference of histone modifications. For TF dimers bound symmetrically to DNA, ASB data revealed that central positions of the TF binding motifs were disproportionately important for binding. Lastly, the impact of variation on TF binding was predicted by a classification model incorporating all the investigated features of ASB events. Classification models using only DNase I hypersensitivity and sequence data exhibited predictive accuracy approaching the models with substantially more features. Taken together, the combination of ASB data and the classification model represents an important step toward elucidating regulatory variants across the human genome.},

Although this is less than 2\% of the 89 million variants reported, it has been shown that the minor alleles can result in 30\% false positives in individual genomes, thus misleading and burdening downstream interpretation. More alarming is the fact that, significant percentage of variants that are homozygous recessive for these minor alleles, with potential disease implications, are masked from reporting. RESULTS: We have demonstrated that the false positives (FP) and false negatives (FN) can be corrected for by simply replacing nucleotides at the minor allele positions in hg19 with corresponding major allele. Here, we have effectively replaced 2.18 million minor alleles Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNPs), Insertion and Deletions (INDELs), Multiple Nucleotide Polymorphism (MNPs) in hg19 with the corresponding major alleles to create an ethnically normalized reference genome called hg19KIndel. In doing so, hg19KIndel has both corrected for sequencing errors acknowledged to be present in hg19 and has improved read alignment near the minor alleles in hg19. CONCLUSION: We have created and made available a new version human reference genome called hg19KIndel. It has been shown that variant calling using hg19KIndel, significantly reduces false positives calls, which in-turn reduces the burden from downstream analysis and validation. It also improved false negative variants call, which means that the variants which were getting missed due to the presence of minor alleles in hg19, will now be called using hg19KIndel. Using hg19KIndel, one even gets a better mapping percentage when compared to currently available human reference genome. hg19KIndel reference genome and its auxiliary datasets are available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.2638113.},

Here, we show that Alu elements resemble enhancers. Alu elements are bound by two well-phased nucleosomes that contain histones bearing marks of active chromatin, and they show tissue-specific enrichment for the enhancer mark H3K4me1. A proportion of Alu elements were experimentally validated as bona fide active enhancers with an in~vitro reporter assay. In addition, Hi-C data indicate that Alus show long-range interactions with gene promoters. We also find that Alus are generally more conserved when located in the proximal upstream region of genes. Their similarity to enhancers becomes more prominent with their age in the human genome, following a clear evolutionary continuum reminiscent of the evolutionary pattern of proto-genes. Therefore, we conclude that some Alu elements can function as enhancers and propose that many more may be proto-enhancers that serve as a repertoire for the de novo birth of enhancers.},

  abstract = {Structural variants are implicated in numerous diseases and make up the majority of varying nucleotides among human genomes. Here we describe an integrated set of eight structural variant classes comprising both balanced and unbalanced variants, which we constructed using short-read DNA sequencing data and statistically phased onto haplotype blocks in 26 human populations. Analysing this set, we identify numerous gene-intersecting structural variants exhibiting population stratification and describe naturally occurring homozygous gene knockouts that suggest the dispensability of a variety of human genes. We demonstrate that structural variants are enriched on haplotypes identified by genome-wide association studies and exhibit enrichment for expression quantitative trait loci. Additionally, we uncover appreciable levels of structural variant complexity at different scales, including genic loci subject to clusters of repeated rearrangement and complex structural variants with multiple breakpoints likely to have formed through individual mutational events. Our catalogue will enhance future studies into structural variant demography, functional impact and disease association.},

  abstract = {Many disciplines, from human genetics and oncology to plant breeding, microbiology and virology, commonly face the challenge of analyzing rapidly increasing numbers of genomes. In case of Homo sapiens, the number of sequenced genomes will approach hundreds of thousands in the next few years. Simply scaling up established bioinformatics pipelines will not be sufficient for leveraging the full potential of such rich genomic data sets. Instead, novel, qualitatively different computational methods and paradigms are needed. We will witness the rapid extension of computational pan-genomics, a new sub-area of research in computational biology. In this article, we generalize existing definitions and understand a pan-genome as any collection of genomic sequences to be analyzed jointly or to be used as a reference. We examine already available approaches to construct and use pan-genomes, discuss the potential benefits of future technologies and methodologies and review open challenges from the vantage point of the above-mentioned biological disciplines. As a prominent example for a computational paradigm shift, we particularly highlight the transition from the representation of reference genomes as strings to representations as graphs. We outline how this and other challenges from different application domains translate into common computational problems, point out relevant bioinformatics techniques and identify open problems in computer science. With this review, we aim to increase awareness that a joint approach to computational pan-genomics can help address many of the problems currently faced in various domains.},

Early findings, however, revealed a more complex genetic architecture than was anticipated for most common diseases \textemdash{} complexity that seemed to limit the immediate utility of these findings. As a result, the practice of utilizing the DNA of an individual to predict disease has been judged to provide little to no useful information. Nevertheless, recent efforts have begun to demonstrate the utility of polygenic risk profiling to identify groups of individuals who could benefit from the knowledge of their probabilistic susceptibility to disease. In this context, we review the evidence supporting the personal and clinical utility of polygenic risk profiling.},

  abstract = {In this work we propose a method to compute continuous embeddings for kmers from raw RNA-seq data, without the need for alignment to a reference genome. The approach uses an RNN to transform kmers of the RNA-seq reads into a 2 dimensional representation that is used to predict abundance of each kmer. We report that our model captures information of both DNA sequence similarity as well as DNA sequence abundance in the embedding latent space, that we call the Latent Transcriptome. We confirm the quality of these vectors by comparing them to known gene sub-structures and report that the latent space recovers exon information from raw RNA-Seq data from acute myeloid leukemia patients. Furthermore we show that this latent space allows the detection of genomic abnormalities such as translocations as well as patient-specific mutations, making this representation space both useful for visualization as well as analysis.},

  abstract = {Tandem DNA repeats vary in the size and sequence of each unit (motif). When expanded, these tandem DNA repeats have been associated with more than 40 monogenic  disorders(1). Their involvement in disorders with complex genetics is largely  unknown, as is the extent of their heterogeneity. Here we investigated the  genome-wide characteristics of tandem repeats that had motifs with a length of 2-20  base pairs in 17,231 genomes of families containing individuals with autism spectrum  disorder (ASD)(2,3) and population control individuals(4). We found extensive  polymorphism in the size and sequence of motifs. Many of the tandem repeat loci that  we detected correlated with cytogenetic fragile sites. At 2,588 loci,  gene-associated expansions of tandem repeats that were rare among population control  individuals were significantly more prevalent among individuals with ASD than their  siblings without ASD, particularly in exons and near splice junctions, and in genes  related to the development of the nervous system and cardiovascular system or  muscle. Rare tandem repeat expansions had a prevalence of 23.3\% in children with ASD  compared with 20.7\% in children without ASD, which suggests that tandem repeat  expansions make a collective contribution to the risk of ASD of 2.6\%. These rare  tandem repeat expansions included previously undescribed ASD-linked expansions in  DMPK and FXN, which are associated with neuromuscular conditions, and in previously  unknown loci such as FGF14 and CACNB1. Rare tandem repeat expansions were associated  with lower IQ and adaptive ability. Our results show that tandem DNA repeat  expansions contribute strongly to the genetic aetiology and phenotypic complexity of  ASD.},

An interesting facet of the KIR family is the unusual variability of the respective gene cluster, which is changing shape at an astonishing evolutionary pace. Not only do KIR genes come in different allelic variants, but the KIR locus has also gone through drastic contractions and expansions in recent evolutionary history, resulting in a wide variety of KIR haplotypes. A new study now reveals how an originally nonfunctional KIR pseudogene, KIR3DP1, is brought back to life in certain individuals via non-reciprocal recombination between two different KIR haplotypes. This Commentary outlines how the unique architecture of the KIR locus facilitates the generation of new KIR haplotypes and discusses the functional relevance of it.

  abstract = {Transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) have recently been employed as an approach that can draw upon the advantages of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and gene expression studies to identify genes associated with complex traits. Unlike standard GWAS, summary level data suffices for TWAS and offers improved statistical power. Two popular TWAS methods include either (a) imputing the cis genetic component of gene expression from smaller sized studies (using multi-SNP prediction or MP) into much larger effective sample sizes afforded by GWAS - TWAS-MP or (b) using summary-based Mendelian randomization - TWAS-SMR. Although these methods have been effective at detecting functional variants, it remains unclear how extensive variability in the genetic architecture of complex traits and diseases impacts TWAS results. Our goal was to investigate the different scenarios under which these methods yielded enough power to detect significant expression-trait associations. In this study, we conducted extensive simulations based on 6000 randomly chosen, unrelated Caucasian males from Geisinger's MyCode population to compare the power to detect cis expression-trait associations (within 500 kb of a gene) using the above-described approaches. To test TWAS across varying genetic backgrounds we simulated gene expression and phenotype using different quantitative trait loci per gene and cis-expression /trait heritability under genetic models that differentiate the effect of causality from that of pleiotropy. For each gene, on a training set ranging from 100 to 1000 individuals, we either (a) estimated regression coefficients with gene expression as the response using five different methods: LASSO, elastic net, Bayesian LASSO, Bayesian spike-slab, and Bayesian ridge regression or (b) performed eQTL analysis. We then sampled with replacement 50,000, 150,000, and 300,000 individuals respectively from the testing set of the remaining 5000 individuals and conducted GWAS on each set. Subsequently, we integrated the GWAS summary statistics derived from the testing set with the weights (or eQTLs) derived from the training set to identify expression-trait associations using (a) TWAS-MP (b) TWAS-SMR (c) eQTL-based GWAS, or (d) standalone GWAS. Finally, we examined the power to detect functionally relevant genes using the different approaches under the considered simulation scenarios. In general, we observed great similarities among TWAS-MP methods although the Bayesian methods resulted in improved power in comparison to LASSO and elastic net as the trait architecture grew more complex while training sample sizes and expression heritability remained small. Finally, we observed high power under causality but very low to moderate power under pleiotropy.},

The standard approach for calculating risk scores involves linkage disequilibrium (LD)-based marker pruning and applying a p~value threshold to association statistics, but this discards information and can reduce predictive accuracy. We introduce LDpred, a method that infers the posterior mean effect size of each marker by using a prior on effect sizes and LD information from an external reference panel. Theory and simulations show that LDpred outperforms the approach of pruning followed by thresholding, particularly at large sample sizes. Accordingly, predicted R(2) increased from 20.1\% to 25.3\% in a large schizophrenia dataset and from 9.8\% to 12.0\% in a large multiple sclerosis dataset. A similar relative improvement in accuracy was observed for three additional large disease datasets and for non-European schizophrenia samples. The advantage of LDpred over existing methods will grow as sample sizes increase.},

  abstract = {DNA sequence alignment tools play an essential role in genomics and genetics. The accuracy of the alignment directly affects the accuracy of downstream analysis, such as variant calling, so it is essential to map reads to the reference genome rapidly and accurately. It has become an essential topic in the field of bioinformatics. Conventional read aligners map reads to a linear reference genome (such as GRCh38 primary). However, the linear reference genome only represents one or a few individuals of genomes, which lacks the variation information in population. It can introduce bias and impact sensitivity and accuracy of mapping. Recently, a few aligners are beginning to map reads to a graph that captures the entire human genome along with a large number of variants. However, compared to linear reference aligners, storing and indexing all genetic variants require costly memory(RAM) space and make extremely long runtime. Aligning reads to a graph model-based index, including the whole set of variants, is ultimately an NP-hard problem in theory. Considering only SNPs information will reduce the complexity of index and improve the speed of alignments. Herein, we present an SNP-aware alignment tool (SALT) that aligns reads to a reference genome that incorporates the SNP database. The SALT is benchmarked both on simulated reads and the real dataset. The results demonstrate that SALT can efficiently map reads to the reference genome, and significantly improve accuracy and sensitivity. Read alignment incorporating SNPs information can improve the sensitivity and accuracy of the read alignment. Moreover, it helps to discover novel variants.

We explore risk loci where TWAS accurately prioritizes the likely causal gene as well as loci where TWAS prioritizes multiple genes, some likely to be non-causal, owing to sharing of expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL). TWAS is especially prone to spurious prioritization with expression data from non-trait-related tissues or cell types, owing to substantial cross-cell-type variation in expression levels and eQTL strengths. Nonetheless, TWAS prioritizes candidate causal genes more accurately than simple baselines. We suggest best practices for causal-gene prioritization with TWAS and discuss future opportunities for improvement. Our results showcase the strengths and limitations of using eQTL datasets to determine causal genes at GWAS loci.},

Additionally, these two ratios are helpful in our understanding of the patterns of DNA sequence evolution. RESULTS: To thoroughly understand these two genomic measures, we performed a study using 1000 Genomes Project (1000G) released genotype data (N=1092). An additional two datasets (N=581 and N=6) were used to validate our findings from the 1000G dataset. We compared the two ratios among continental ancestry, genome regions and gene functionality. We found that the Ti/Tv ratio can be used as a quality indicator for single nucleotide polymorphisms inferred from high-throughput sequencing data. The Ti/Tv ratio varies greatly by genome region and functionality, but not by ancestry. The het/nonref-hom ratio varies greatly by ancestry, but not by genome regions and functionality. Furthermore, extreme guanine + cytosine content (either high or low) is negatively associated with the Ti/Tv ratio magnitude. Thus, when performing QC assessment using these two measures, care must be taken to apply the correct thresholds based on ancestry and genome region. Failure to take these considerations into account at the QC stage will bias any following analysis.

In this study, using Illumina high-throughput sequencing of maize transcriptomics, chromatic H3K27me3 histone modification and DNA methylation data, we developed a new computational framework to identify allele-specifically expressed genes by simultaneously tracking allele-specific gene expression patterns and the epigenetic modification landscape in the seedling tissues of hybrid maize. This approach relies on detecting nucleotide polymorphisms and any genomic structural variation between two parental genomes in order to distinguish paternally or maternally derived sequencing reads.

Over the past decade, thousands of human genomes have been sequenced, contributing deeply to biomedical research. In the vast majority of cases, these have been analyzed by aligning sequence reads to a single reference genome, biasing the resulting analyses, and in general, failing to capture sequences novel to a given genome. Some de novo assemblies have been constructed free of reference bias, but nearly all were constructed by merging homologous loci into single ``consensus'' sequences, generally absent from nature. These assemblies do not correctly represent the diploid biology of an individual. In exactly two cases, true diploid de novo assemblies have been made, at great expense. One was generated using Sanger sequencing, and one using thousands of clone pools. Here, we demonstrate a straightforward and low-cost method for creating true diploid de novo assemblies. We make a single library from {$\sim$}1 ng of high molecular weight DNA, using the 10x Genomics microfluidic platform to partition the genome. We applied this technique to seven human samples, generating low-cost HiSeq X data, then assembled these using a new ``pushbutton'' algorithm, Supernova. Each computation took 2 d on a single server. Each yielded contigs longer than 100 kb, phase blocks longer than 2.5 Mb, and scaffolds longer than 15 Mb. Our method provides a scalable capability for determining the actual diploid genome sequence in a sample, opening the door to new approaches in genomic biology and medicine.},

  abstract = {Structural variation~(SV) constitutes an important type of genetic mutations providing the raw material for evolution. Here, we uncover the genome-wide spectrum of intra- and interspecific SV segregating in natural populations of seven songbird species in the genus Corvus. Combining short-read (N\,=\,127) and long-read re-sequencing (N\,=\,31), as well as optical mapping (N\,=\,16), we apply both assembly- and read mapping approaches to detect SV and characterize a total of 220,452 insertions, deletions and inversions. We exploit sampling across wide phylogenetic timescales to validate SV genotypes and assess the contribution of SV to evolutionary processes in an avian model of incipient speciation. We reveal an evolutionary young (\textasciitilde 530,000 years) cis-acting 2.25-kb LTR retrotransposon insertion reducing expression of the NDP gene with consequences for premating isolation. Our results attest to the wealth and evolutionary significance of SV segregating in natural populations and highlight the need for reliable SV genotyping.},

  abstract = {Managing the contribution of forest ecosystems to global carbon cycles requires accurate predictions of biomass dynamics in relation to stand development. Our study evaluated competing hypotheses regarding late-successional biomass dynamics in northern hardwood-conifer forests using a data set spanning the northeastern United States, including 48 mature and 46 old-growth stands. Continuous data on dominant tree ages were available for 29 of these and were used as an indicator of stand development. Aboveground live biomass was significantly (P \&lt; 0.001) different between mature (195 Mg/ha) and old-growth (266 Mg/ha) sites. Aboveground biomass was positively (P \&lt; 0.001) and logarithmically correlated with dominant tree age; this held for live trees (r2 = 0.52), standing dead trees (r2 = 0.36), total trees (r2 = 0.63), and downed woody debris (r2 = 0.24). In a Classification and Regression Tree analysis, stand age class was the strongest predictor of biomass, but ecoregion and percent conifer accounted for {$\sim$}25\textendash 33\% of intraregional variability. Biomass approached maximum values in stands with dominant tree ages of {$\sim$}350\textendash 400 years. Our results support the hypothesis that aboveground biomass can accumulate very late into succession in northern hardwood-conifer forests, recognizing that early declines are also possible in secondary forests as reported previously. Empirical studies suggest a high degree of variability in biomass development pathways and these may differ from theoretical predictions. Primary forest systems, especially those prone to partial disturbances, may have different biomass dynamics compared with those of secondary forests. These differences have important implications for both the quantity and temporal dynamics of carbon storage in old-growth and recovering secondary forests.},

We build on existing computational methods to combine Alu detection and de novo assembly of WGS data as a means to reconstruct the full sequence of insertion events from Illumina paired end reads. Comparison with published calls obtained using PacBio long-reads indicates a false discovery rate below 5\%, at the cost of reduced sensitivity due to the colocation of reference and non-reference repeats. We generate a highly accurate call set of 1614 completely assembled Alu variants from 53 samples from the Human Genome Diversity Project (HGDP) panel. We utilize the reconstructed alternative insertion haplotypes to genotype 1010 fully assembled insertions, obtaining {$>$}99\% agreement with genotypes obtained by PCR. In our assembled sequences, we find evidence of premature insertion mechanisms and observe 5' truncation in 16\% of AluYa5 and AluYb8 insertions. The sites of truncation coincide with stem-loop structures and SRP9/14 binding sites in the Alu RNA, implicating L1 ORF2p pausing in the generation of 5' truncations. Additionally, we identified variable AluJ and AluS elements that likely arose due to non-retrotransposition mechanisms.},

  abstract = {The human endogenous retrovirus (HERV) group HERV-K contains nearly intact and insertionally polymorphic integrations among humans, many of which code for viral proteins. Expression of such HERV-K proviruses occurs in tissues associated with cancers and autoimmune diseases, and in HIV-infected individuals, suggesting possible pathogenic effects. Proper characterization of these elements necessitates the discrimination of individual HERV-K loci; such studies are hampered by our incomplete catalog of HERV-K insertions, motivating the identification of additional HERV-K copies in humans. By examining \&gt;2,500 sequenced genomes, we have discovered 19 previously unidentified HERV-K insertions, including an intact provirus without apparent substitutions that would alter viral function, only the second such provirus described. Our results provide a basis for future studies of HERV evolution and implication for disease.Endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) have contributed to more than 8\% of the human genome. The majority of these elements lack function due to accumulated mutations or internal recombination resulting in a solitary (solo) LTR, although members of one group of human ERVs (HERVs), HERV-K, were recently active with members that remain nearly intact, a subset of which is present as insertionally polymorphic loci that include approximately full-length (2-LTR) and solo-LTR alleles in addition to the unoccupied site. Several 2-LTR insertions have intact reading frames in some or all genes that are expressed as functional proteins. These properties reflect the activity of HERV-K and suggest the existence of additional unique loci within humans. We sought to determine the extent to which other polymorphic insertions are present in humans, using sequenced genomes from the 1000 Genomes Project and a subset of the Human Genome Diversity Project panel. We report analysis of a total of 36 nonreference polymorphic HERV-K proviruses, including 19 newly reported loci, with insertion frequencies ranging from \&lt;0.0005 to \&gt;0.75 that varied by population. Targeted screening of individual loci identified three new unfixed 2-LTR proviruses within our set, including an intact provirus present at Xq21.33 in some individuals, with the potential for retained infectivity.},

Here we study mapping bias in whole-genome bisulfite sequencing using data from inbred mice. We show that the choice of reference genome used for alignment can profoundly impact the inferred methylation state, both for high and low resolution analyses. This bias can result in wrongly identifying thousands of differentially methylated regions and hundreds of megabases of large-scale methylation differences. We show that the direction of these biased methylation differences can be reversed by changing the reference genome, clearly establishing mapping bias as a primary cause. We develop a strategy termed personalize-then-smooth for removing the bias by coupling alignment to personal genomes, with post-alignment smoothing. The smoothing step can be viewed as imputation, and allows a differential analysis to include methylation sites which are only present in some samples. Our results have important implications for analysis of bisulfite converted DNA.},

A growing number of cases of adaptive introgression are being identified in species across the tree of life, however the timing of selection, and therefore the importance of the different evolutionary roles of admixture, is typically unknown. Here, we investigate the spatio-temporal history of selection favoring Neanderthal-introgressed alleles in modern human populations. Using both ancient and present-day samples of modern humans, we integrate the known demographic history of populations, namely population divergence and migration, with tests for selection. We model how a sweep placed along different branches of an admixture graph acts to modify the variance and covariance in neutral allele frequencies among populations at linked loci. Using a method based on this model of allele frequencies, we study previously identified cases of Neanderthal adaptive introgression. From these, we identify cases in which Neanderthal introgressed alleles were quickly beneficial and other cases in which they persisted at low frequency for some time. For some of the alleles that persisted at low frequency, we show that selection likely independently favored them later on in geographically separated populations. Our work highlights how admixture with ancient hominins has contributed to modern human adaptation, contextualizes observed levels of Neanderthal ancestry in present-day and ancient samples, and identifies cases of temporally varying selection that are sometimes shared across large geographic distances.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

A large body of work from evolutionary biology, economics, and ecology has shown that specialization is beneficial when further division of labor produces an accelerating increase in absolute productivity (i.e. productivity is a convex function of specialization). Here we show that reproductive specialization is qualitatively different from classical models of resource sharing, and can evolve even when the benefits of specialization are saturating (i.e. productivity is a concave function of specialization). Through analytical theory and evolutionary individual-based simulations, we demonstrate that reproductive specialization is strongly favored in sparse networks of cellular interactions that reflect the morphology of early, simple multicellular organisms, highlighting the importance of restricted social interactions in the evolution of reproductive specialization.},

  abstract = {Summary: Genome-wide association studies are widely used to investigate the genetic basis of diseases and traits, but they pose many computational challenges. We developed gdsfmt and SNPRelate (R packages for multi-core symmetric multiprocessing computer architectures) to accelerate two key computations on SNP data: principal component analysis (PCA) and relatedness analysis using identity-by-descent measures. The kernels of our algorithms are written in C/C++ and highly optimized. Benchmarks show the uniprocessor implementations of PCA and identity-by-descent are {$\sim$}8\textendash 50 times faster than the implementations provided in the popular EIGENSTRAT (v3.0) and PLINK (v1.07) programs, respectively, and can be sped up to 30\textendash 300-fold by using eight cores. SNPRelate can analyse tens of thousands of samples with millions of SNPs. For example, our package was used to perform PCA on 55 324 subjects from the `Gene-Environment Association Studies' consortium studies.Availability and implementation: gdsfmt and SNPRelate are available from R CRAN (http://cran.r-project.org), including a vignette.

  abstract = {The 1000 Genomes Project produced more than 100 trillion basepairs of short read sequence from more than 2600 samples in 26 populations over a period of five years. In its final phase, the project released over 85 million genotyped and phased variants on human reference genome assembly GRCh37. An updated reference assembly, GRCh38, was released in late 2013, but there was insufficient time for the final phase of the project analysis to change to the new assembly. Although it is possible to lift the coordinates of the 1000 Genomes Project variants to the new assembly, this is a potentially error-prone process as coordinate remapping is most appropriate only for non-repetitive regions of the genome and those that did not see significant change between the two assemblies. It will also miss variants in any region that was newly added to GRCh38. Thus, to produce the highest quality variants and genotypes on GRCh38, the best strategy is to realign the reads and recall the variants based on the new alignment. As the first step of variant calling for the 1000 Genomes Project data, we have finished remapping all of the 1000 Genomes sequence reads to GRCh38 with alternative scaffold\textendash aware BWA-MEM. The resulting alignments are available as CRAM, a reference-based sequence compression format. The data have been released on our FTP site and are also available from European Nucleotide Archive to facilitate researchers discovering variants on the primary sequences and alternative contigs of GRCh38.},

  abstract = {K562 is widely used in biomedical research. It is one of three tier-one cell lines of ENCODE and also most commonly used for large-scale CRISPR/Cas9 screens. Although its functional genomic and epigenomic characteristics have been extensively studied, its genome sequence and genomic structural features have never been comprehensively analyzed. Such information is essential for the correct interpretation and understanding of the vast troves of existing functional genomics and epigenomics data for K562. We performed and integrated deep-coverage whole-genome (short-insert), mate-pair, and linked-read sequencing as well as karyotyping and array CGH analysis to identify a wide spectrum of genome characteristics in K562: copy numbers (CN) of aneuploid chromosome segments at high-resolution, SNVs and Indels (both corrected for CN in aneuploid regions), loss of heterozygosity, mega-base-scale phased haplotypes often spanning entire chromosome arms, structural variants (SVs) including small and large-scale complex SVs and non-reference retrotransposon insertions. Many SVs were phased, assembled, and experimentally validated. We identified multiple allele-specific deletions and duplications within the tumor suppressor gene FHIT. Taking aneuploidy into account, we re-analyzed K562 RNA-seq and whole-genome bisulfite sequencing data for allele-specific expression and allele-specific DNA methylation. We also show examples of how deeper insights into regulatory complexity are gained by integrating genomic variant information and structural context with functional genomics and epigenomics data. Furthermore, using K562 haplotype information, we produced an allele-specific CRISPR targeting map. This comprehensive whole-genome analysis serves as a resource for future studies that utilize K562 as well as a framework for the analysis of other cancer genomes.},

  abstract = {Structural variation (SV), including insertions and deletions (indels), is a primary mechanism of genome evolution. However, the mechanism by which SV contributes to epigenome evolution is poorly understood. In this study, we characterized the association between lineage-specific indels and epigenome differences between human and chimpanzee to investigate how SVs might have shaped the epigenetic landscape. By intersecting medium-to-large human\textendash chimpanzee indels (20 bp\textendash 50 kb) with putative promoters and enhancers in cranial neural crest cells (CNCCs) and repressed regions in induced pluripotent cells (iPSCs), we found that 12\% of indels overlap putative regulatory and repressed regions (RRRs), and 15\% of these indels are associated with lineage-biased RRRs. Indel-associated putative enhancer and repressive regions are approximately 1.3 times and approximately three times as likely to be lineage-biased, respectively, as those not associated with indels. We found a twofold enrichment of medium-sized indels (20\textendash 50 bp) in CpG island (CGI)\textendash containing promoters than expected by chance. Lastly, from human-specific transposable element insertions, we identified putative regulatory elements, including NR2F1-bound putative CNCC enhancers derived from SVAs and putative iPSC promoters derived from LTR5s. Our results show that different types of indels are associated with specific epigenomic diversity between human and chimpanzee.},
