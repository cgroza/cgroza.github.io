I am a bioinformatics PhD student in Guillaume Bourque's lab at McGill University.
I apply genome graphs, sequence assembly and string matching algorithms in the area of epigenomics.
Particularly, I am looking to find epigenomic events that are obscured by the inability of reference genomes to represent human genetic variation.
To this end, I exploit large whole genome sequencing, ChIP-seq and ATAC-seq datasets.
While following this line of research, I also became acquainted with transposable elements.
A list of my publications can be found [on this page](/pubs/).

I am also interested in programming languages that bring new concepts from the functional world into the imperative mainstream.
Over the years, I have experimented with Haskell, Erlang, a few Lisps and Rust.
Therefore, I am quite excited to see how functional programming will affect bioinformatics software development in the future.
It would certainly be refreshing to see algorithms written in a language with a strong and expressive type system and not in weakly typed imperative C.
