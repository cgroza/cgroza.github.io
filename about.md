I am a bioinformatics PhD student in Guillaume Bourque's lab at McGill University.
I apply genome graphs, sequence assembly and string matching algorithms in the area of epigenomics.
Particularly, I am looking to find epigenomic events that are obscured by a genome reference that fails to accurately represent human genetic variation.
A list of my publications can be found [on this page](/pubs/).
